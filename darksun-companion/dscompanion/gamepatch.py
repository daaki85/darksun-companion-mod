"""The patched copy of the game the dice log runs: DSUNLOG.EXE.

The copy differs from DSUN.EXE in a few places, each replaced by an INT
instruction that DSCLOG.EXE answers (see dos/dsclog.asm):

  * the start of rand(), so every random number goes through DSCLOG, which
    gives the same numbers and records who asked;
  * the end of the saving throw, where DSCLOG records the final total and the
    number it had to reach;
  * the end of the AC calculation, where DSCLOG records the AC the game uses;
  * the start of the routine that feeds the dialogue window, where DSCLOG
    copies the text, the replies to choose from and the portrait shown;
  * the start of the message box routine ("... is broken !", level ups);
  * two places where the game adds up AC and saving throw modifiers, so that a worn
    ring with a plus (the Ring +1 the companion can put in the arena) counts;
  * the routine that lists a character's weapons, where DSCLOG adds each one's THAC0;
  * the start of a turn in a fight, where DSCLOG can add a move for boots (a rule change
    the companion turns on, like AC 1 for helms, which the AC place above gives).

A last change lets the copy live outside the game folder: the game looks for
its data files in the folder its EXE is in, and the copy looks in the current
folder instead (the launcher runs it from the game folder).

Patching the file rather than the running game means the patches are in place
before the game runs, including in overlays each time they are loaded. The
original DSUN.EXE is only read.
