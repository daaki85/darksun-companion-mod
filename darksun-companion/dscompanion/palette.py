"""Templar's Ledger's colours: sampled from Shattered Lands' own screens.

Every colour was sampled from the game (GOG release, in DOSBox): the grey stone
of its panels and buttons, the amber of dialogue text, the yellow of the
character screen's numbers, the dark red rock of the arena walls and the sand.

Accessibility (AODA, whose standard is WCAG 2.0 level AA): every colour used
for text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 with the background it is used
on (TEXT_PAIRS lists them; tests/test_theme.py checks each one). The game's
lighter stone is kept for bevels and edges, not behind text.
