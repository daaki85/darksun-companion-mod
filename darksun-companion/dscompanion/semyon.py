"""Semyon in the slave pens, after he has fought beside the party and left the arena.

Semyon (the arena's Tied-up Prisoner, untied: object SEMYON) meets the party again in the
arena's bone area; recruited to the Alliance (the game's flag 6), he fights beside them in the
next fight and, if he survives, leaves: "That's enough for me. I'm leaving. I'll go find more
members for the Alliance." (script 2). Some of his replies in the bone area send him off before
that ("I'll see you in the holding pens", script 5). Each way he walks out through the arena's
entrance to the pens and a script takes him off the map, and nothing in the pens ever brings him
back.

The Ledger changes only the way after the fight: script 2 sends him walking out and, when he gets
there, runs script 5 at EXIT, which takes him off the map (5Eh to region 255); nothing else runs
that command. There, the Ledger's copy first sets its flag LEFT. A Semyon killed (in that fight,
or anywhere) the Ledger marks with its flag DIED (watch), and he is never put in the pens then.
The pens' master script (MAS 41) then puts him in his pen the way the
arena's script first put him on the map (25h: an object made at a place, as script 5 does when
he is untied): once LEFT is set, the first time the party is in the pens after it he is in the
free pen above Kalzith's (CELL), and talking to him runs his conversation (script SCRIPT). The
other ways he leaves, and a Semyon killed in the fight, stay as in the game: he isn't there.

His words are his own voice from the arena (a cheerful scout of the Veiled Alliance, who hid a
gem in one of the pens' grain pots), with no narration, as the game's talks.
