"""Two magic robes for those who go without armour: preservers, psionicists and druids (the
type's class bits). A robe is worn on the chest, in the chest armour's place, its plus counting
for AC as bracers' does (and, like them, only with no armour on the arms, legs or head), and it
isn't armour: a preserver casts in it, a cloak of protection still counts (DSCLOG's ROBE type,
BRACERS_AX, ROBE_PLUS).

- The Ashen Robe (+1): AC 1 better, and +1 on saves against wizards' and priests' spells. Worn by
  Kalzith once his scrolls are sold, and left with his body (kalzith.py).
- The Veiled Robe (+2), a robe of the Veiled Alliance: AC 2 better, +1 on every save, and a
  wizard spell slot more at spell levels 1 to 3 where its wearer has any. Sold by Kel
  (worldgear.py).

The two are told apart by their plus (the item's +14h)."""
