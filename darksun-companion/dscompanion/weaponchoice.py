"""New characters' weapon kinds and starting weapon (weapon specialization).

A character is chosen its kinds on the creation panel (weaponpages.py); before it is first
played (its status New) the Ledger makes them whole:

- a fighter or ranger has one kind, the long sword if none was marked (a Myrmidon, kits.py, a
  second if marked; a Battle Mage, kits.py, one of its own); a gladiator two, the long sword and the club if none were; any other class
  none (marked as a warrior, then made something else);
- the game's starting weapon, the bone long sword in the right hand, becomes a plain weapon of
  the first kind, of bone or obsidian where the game has one, in a material the character can use
  (a fire cleric's long sword obsidian), with its picture and name; the short sword and the axe
  are the Ledger's own, of bone (the game has no short sword but Kurzak's, Shadowseeker, and only
  a metal axe). A bow, sling or staff sling goes to the missile slot, and a bow comes with
  arrows; a weapon in both hands sends the starting shield to the backpack.

With kits (kit_gear), the game's starting gear fitted to the kit, whatever the weapon rules: a
weapon the kit forbids becomes one it allows (a Shinobi's long sword a short sword, a Brute's a
great axe, a Seeker's of its sphere's material), a shield or off-hand weapon it forbids goes to
the backpack (a Ravager's shield, a Brute's club), an Arena Champion's off-hand club becomes a
shield, and a Battle Mage's quarterstaff its chosen weapon spec's weapon.
