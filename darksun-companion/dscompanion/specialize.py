"""Weapon specialization (the Options tab's rule): the weapon kinds a fighter, gladiator or ranger
can choose, and which of the game's item types each takes in.

The game has no notion of a weapon's kind: its item types are one per weapon and material (a
metal, a bone and an obsidian long sword are three), and its named weapons are types of their
own (Bloodwrath, Swiftbite). KIND_OF_TYPE sorts every weapon type into one of the sixteen KINDS,
by its dice, weight and name; the spell-made weapons (Flame Blade, Shillelagh, Spiritual
Hammer), the gloves and the broken weapon are none.

The kinds come in the order of the character creation panel's four weapon pages, four to a
page, long sword first: the default, as the game marks the first psionic discipline and
clerical sphere; a gladiator's two at creation are the long sword and the club, the first two.
