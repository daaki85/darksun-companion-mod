"""Class restrictions (the Options tab's rule): what a character's classes keep it from equipping,
on top of the game's own class lists (each item type's mask of the classes that may use it, of
which one of the character's classes is enough). The strictest class wins. DSCLOG's
PROBE_CAN_USE does this in the game; this is its model, for the tests and the Ledger.

- A psionicist, whatever its other classes allow: light armour only (leather, hide, silk), a
  leather shield only, and of weapons only daggers, short swords, maces, clubs, chatkchas, bows
  and slings.
- A multiclass thief: light armour only, and a shield only a leather one that another of its
  classes allows.
- A preserver of that one class: no armour and no shield (a Battle Mage, kits.py, may wear light
  armour all the same: kit_allows).
- A druid: no armour, no shield.
- A cleric: only the weapons of its sphere, or of any of its spheres (a ranger who became a
  cleric keeps the ranger's): air, missile and thrown weapons and daggers; earth, stone,
  obsidian, metal and wood; fire, obsidian; water, bone and wood.

- A multiclass preserver: no spells, wizard or priest, while it wears armour (DSCLOG's
  PROBE_NO_CAST, at the game's test for its "No spell use" effect); a shield doesn't count.

A human who was a fighter, gladiator or ranger and has changed class keeps the weapons it
specialized in, whatever the new class allows, once its new class's level has passed the old.
A ranger's bow is its own the same way (every ranger has expertise with it): a multiclass
ranger may use bows whatever its other classes allow (a fire cleric's sphere), and so may a
human once ranger, as its chosen weapons.

Helms count as armour. A human who has changed class (dual-classed: the class it has now is the
first) is held only by that class; another race's classes (multiclass) all hold it. Weapons of
no kind (spell-made weapons, gloves, the broken weapon) are as the game has them.
