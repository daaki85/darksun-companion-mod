"""The cooked vulture: a meal at last.

Hitting the arena's vulture knocks its feathers off (a plucked vulture), and the slave pens'
campfire cooks it, but nothing in the game ever uses the cooked vulture. With the Ledger, Dinos
(the pens' fine cook) is asked about it in his talk while the party carries it ("We cooked the
vulture from the arena.", pensasks.py): he takes it, shows them how to prepare it properly and
they eat it together, with the sound of a quest done. His script sets the Ledger's flag MEAL, on
which the Ledger gives each party member XP_REWARD XP and restores them as after a full rest (HP,
PSP and spell slots), once (EATEN).

Eaten by the party themselves (used on one of them, DSCLOG's PROBE_USE_ITEM), it is no use.
