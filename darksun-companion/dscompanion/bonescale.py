"""The rest of the bone scale armour, in the chest with its chest piece.

The game has Bone Scale Chest Armor, Arm Armor and Leg Armor (objects 1033-1035, the arm and leg
pieces never placed anywhere in play) but no helm of bone. It puts the chest piece in a chest of
the slave pens (object 1564, with Arrows +3). In the Ledger's copy of SEGOBJEX the arm and leg
pieces and a Bone Helm (an item type of the companion's own: the Helm's, of bone, with an icon of
its own in the bone scale's colours, icons.py) are in that chest too (dataitems.py, worldgear.py's
data_chunks), so the game makes the set together.
