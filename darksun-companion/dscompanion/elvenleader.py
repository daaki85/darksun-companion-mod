"""The Elven Leader's gift: the Cloak of Elvenkind with his Gythka (+2: worldgear.py), given by his own script.

After the fight with his men (script 46), he says "You are true warriors! ... I give you a gift
that I received from a thri-kreen I once knew. Here." and gives the one talking to him the
Gythka (object 2534: command 39h, a new item of that object to them), or, when they can't
carry it, says so and leaves it on the ground by him (25h). Then a click (the window's "more")
and the talk goes on.

In the Ledger's copy of the scripts, that click becomes a jump to code after the script's end
(as alagorn.py's): a new page, his words for the cloak, the cloak given the same way, an object
of the Ledger's own (CLOAK: its record the Cloak of Elvenkind's, worldgear.py, in the Ledger's
copy of SEGOBJEX), or left on the ground by him with a word when it can't be carried; then the
click, and back.
