"""Two plain weapons made magic (the MAGIC_ARMS switch, on unless turned off), in the game's data
(dataitems.py: the Ledger's copy of SEGOBJEX, written as the game is started).

- The 2 handed Bone Gythka on the dead body lying by the stone arch in the arena, where every game
  starts: Kreenfang, a gythka +1. The body is the game's object 1204, "Dead Body" (an item whose
  contents are a list: its record has the gythka in it), used nowhere else; in the copy, that
  gythka is Kreenfang. Every other gythka stays plain: the one the arena also has lying loose
  (object 1011), and those in kreen hands.
- Kurzak's Short Sword (npcitems.py): Shadowseeker, a short sword +1. Whoever wields it (in either
  hand) can see the invisible: the game's own way with a magic item's spell (its +0Fh, one past
  the spell's number), which it puts on the wearer when the item is readied and takes off when
  it's put away, for a spell it counts as helpful (Detect Invisibility is; a weapon's other
  spells are cast on what it hits instead). Its item box shows the spell's icon (its +02h:
  right-clicked, the spell's description).

Each has a name of its own, as the Templar's Bloodwrath (an obsidian long sword +1, 20800) has, in
entries DSCLOG adds (names.py); is priced near it; and has an icon of its own (icons.py:
Kreenfang's blades in the fire colours, Shadowseeker's night steel). The game shows the plus with the
name ("+1 Kreenfang"), and it counts for hitting and damage as any magic weapon's.
