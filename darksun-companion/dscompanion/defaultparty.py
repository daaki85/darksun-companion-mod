"""The game's own party, the one START GAME plays when no party has been made: made ready for
the rule changes, once, while the game is new (tools.new_game: its first hour, in the arena).

They are the game's objects (32000 to 32003, and 300, 307, 308 and 313 for their figures), a
creature record and a sheet each, already Okay, so the Ledger's way with a new character
(weaponchoice.finish_new) passes them by; the game gives them their gear and spells as it
starts. Each is known by name, race and classes together.

- With weapon specialization: their weapon kinds, matching what they carry. Gerakis (a
  half-giant gladiator) the long sword and the gythka, with the half-giants' rule his club a
  bone gythka, in the same hand: a two-handed weapon beside a one-handed one (the long sword
  weighs 20, the gythka 120: one heavy weapon, as the game allows). K'ratchek (a fighter,
  druid and psionicist) the chatkcha, the one weapon she has. Cermak (a gladiator who became a
  preserver) the long sword and the axe, which count once his gladiator levels do again.
- With class restrictions: Cilla (a preserver, druid and thief) can't wear armour (the druid's
  rule), so her leather armour is taken away and she knows Armor, the first wizard spell (0),
  the one Old One-Eye's scroll in the fields teaches.
