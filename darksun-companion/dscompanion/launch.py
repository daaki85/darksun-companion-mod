"""Starting the GOG release of Shattered Lands with the dice log.

GOG runs DOSBox with two config files: dosbox_darksun.conf (settings) and
dosbox_darksun_single.conf (the [autoexec] that mounts the game and shows a
small menu). We keep the first and replace the second with our own
[autoexec], which also mounts the companion's dos folder as D:, loads
DSCLOG.EXE into upper memory, and runs DSUNLOG.EXE: a patched copy of the
game (see gamepatch.py) that the launcher keeps in the dos folder. Nothing in
the game folder is changed.
