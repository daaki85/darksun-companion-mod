"""Hiding in shadows and moving silently in a fight (RULE_STEALTH): a way to backstab.

The game never rolls hide in shadows, and a backstab needs the thief to stand behind a target
that has turned to face someone else. With the rule on, a thief whose turn comes with no enemy
next to them tries to hide in shadows (the chance halved in daylight: on open ground under
Athas's sun), and if they do, to move silently up to someone. Both succeeding, the thief's next
attack this turn counts as one from behind (DSCLOG's PROBE_STEALTH), and so as a backstab with
a weapon that can backstab; attacking gives them away, and the turn ending ends the hiding.
Worn, a cloak adds CLOAK_HIDE to hiding in shadows and boots BOOTS_QUIET to moving silently
(at most MOST), before the light halves it.

Rangers do it too, with AD&D's chances for a ranger (the game gives them no thief skills;
game.ranger_skill_parts), but the other way round for the light: outdoorsmen, they hide with
the full chance under the open sky and half of it indoors. Their attack from behind is no
backstab (DSCLOG's own check keeps that to thieves). Someone with thief levels hides as a thief.

Daylight goes by the region (the map) the party is in: open desert, rock and the arena are
outdoors; the slave pens, the sewers, the caverns and the other underground or roofed places
are not. A few maps have both: buildings with floors of their own on open ground. There, it
goes by the floor under the thief: the game's map of the region (its RMAP, one tile number a
square) says which, and the tile numbers of those maps' indoor floors are below.
