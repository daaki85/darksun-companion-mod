"""Thieving tools: an item of the companion's own that picks pockets.

Every thief starts a new game with a set (in the backpack's first free cell): while the game
is new (its first hour, in the arena where every game starts), any thief in the party without
one gets one. Later on, a thief the Ledger hasn't seen before (an older game, someone who
joins) gets a set once. Picked up on
the inventory screen and taken back to the game, the pointer carries them; clicked on someone,
the patched game's routine for using an item on something (DSCLOG's PROBE_USE_ITEM) has the
Ledger try that person's pockets with the leader's hand (pickpocket.py), and shows what came
of it. The item is a small one of the game's "misc" type. Its name, "Thieves' Tools", is the
second of the entries DSCLOG adds after the game's own (names.py); the tools are told apart by
that name, their picture and their type together.
