"""Father Garyn's gift: the Tome of Understanding (tome.py), when the party brings him the ranike
pith, given by his own script.

In his talk (script 174), "I'm here to deliver a bag of pith to you." has him thank them the
first time (while flag FLAG is 0), tell them how the extract is made and to take it to Linara,
and set FLAG. In the Ledger's copy of the scripts, the command setting it becomes a jump to code
after the script's end (as elvenleader.py's): the first time, a new page, his words, the tome
given (command 39h, a new item of its object, to the one talking to him), or left on the ground
by him when it can't be carried (25h); then FLAG set, as before, and back.
