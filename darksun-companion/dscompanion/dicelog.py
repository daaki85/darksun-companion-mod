"""Dice log: shows the rolls Shattered Lands makes behind the scenes.

How it works:
  * The launcher runs DSUNLOG.EXE, a copy of the game whose rand() and two
    "probe" places (the end of the saving throw and of the AC calculation)
    start with INT instructions (see gamepatch.py).
  * DSCLOG.EXE (see dos/dsclog.asm), loaded before the game, answers those
    interrupts. Its rand() gives the same numbers as the game's but also
    records each call and the caller's stack frames in a ring buffer; the
    probes record the game's final numbers there.
  * attach() finds DSCLOG and the game in DOSBox's memory; lines() reads new
    entries and turns them into text, using what the calling code does with
    each number and the game's own data (names, THAC0, weapons, spell effects).

Everything game-specific here was taken from the GOG release of Shattered
Lands (DSUN.EXE, 611408 bytes).
