"""The Ring +1: an item of the companion's own, on the Tied-up Prisoner in the arena.

The game has a plain "Ring" item type that nothing in it has a plus on. The dice log's
patched game makes a worn ring's plus better AC and saving throws (DSCLOG's PROBE_RING_AC
and PROBE_RING_SAVE). When the Tied-up Prisoner dies (cut from his bonds, or killed where he
hangs), the game leaves his body, which can't be opened: looking at it, the arena's script
says "There is nothing on the body." While the ring is still to be found, the Ledger has
DSCLOG show SEARCH_TEXT instead of that line (its text swap), and then puts the ring in the
leader's backpack (give_ring): an item record from the game's free list. Once the party has
it, the game keeps and saves it like any other item.

Finding it is worth XP_REWARD XP to the one who searched, given as the game gives its quests'
XP to one person (with_xp): its window, "Gerakis receives 50 experience points!", and the
sound of a quest done, as the cooked vulture's meal (vulture.py).
