"""Where Shattered Lands (GOG release, DSUN.EXE) keeps things in memory.

The game is a 16-bit Borland C++ program. Its data segment (DS) starts with
Borland's copyright string at DS:0004, which makes DS easy to find; the
creature and character-sheet tables are reached through far pointers in DS.

Other data lives in segments at fixed distances from the load segment (DS -
0x4356). The game's overlaid code names these segments with different
numbers; the real ones are given here.
