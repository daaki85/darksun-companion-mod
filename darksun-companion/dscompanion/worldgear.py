"""New weapons and bracers in the world: merchants' stock and people's packs.

- The Ledger's plain weapons (weaponchoice.py): the bone and obsidian short swords and axes, the
  obsidian mace and a plain metal short sword. The game has no other short sword than Kurzak's,
  no axe but a metal one, and no obsidian mace but Blackmace. The two merchants who sell plain
  weapons stock them, and a few kinds of people carry one, as their loot.
- Metal versions of the plain weapons the game has in no metal (a dagger but Dag's Dagger +3, a
  mace, a great axe, a pick, a polearm): one each, on people who fight with the like.
- Magic weapons of the kinds the game has none of (a club, a pick, a staff sling; a short sword
  but Shadowseeker): one each, priced as the game's magic weapons of the like.
- A circlet and a crown, worn on the head and not armour (no AC; bracers of defense and a
  preserver's spells go with them), each with a spell the game keeps on its wearer while it's
  worn, as it does its own magic items': Arrowbane, Protection from Normal Missiles, sold by
  Kel; the Sunking Crown, Protection from Evil 10' Radius (the party round its wearer warded),
  worn by Keldar, the templar of Dagolar's tunnels.
- The Warden's Plate, plate mail +1 (DSCLOG's plate types: AC 3 chest, 2 arms, 2 legs, as AD&D's
  piecemeal plate; the helm the game's metal one), its four pieces scattered: the helm on
  Dagolar's body; the arms in the Lower Castle's treasure chest with Dark Flame (behind the
  wall the Serpent Boots show, the vrock's cliff); the legs in the Gemfields' chest; the chest
  on Balkazar's body. The chest puts Resist Fire on its wearer while worn, the helm Cloak of
  Bravery; the arms and legs are plain.
- The Cloak and Boots of Elvenkind (DSCLOG's types, the game's Cloak's and Boots', for thieves and
  rangers; their stealth: stealth.py): the cloak the Elven Leader's gift with his Gythka (+2: his
  script gives it: elvenleader.py), the boots in the buried chest of Kel's caravan, with the
  Cahulaks +1.
- The Flame Blade, an obsidian long sword +1 (fire clerics can wield it) whose blade burns what it
  hits, as the game's Dark Flame does with Burning Hands: Focus Heat, the fire clerics' spell, cast
  as a weapon's spells are, at caster level 0: 2d6 of fire to the one hit, a save for half (AD&D's
  flame blade: 1d6 of fire; the game's Produce Fire, 1d6, sets the ground alight and burns friends
  standing there): in the pack of the Hot Springs' Templar (the one with the Drake Shield).
- The magic axes: Drakejaw, a bone axe +1, on one of the Magera guarding the wagon's prisoners;
  Glasshewer, an obsidian axe +2, on the elven slavers' Templar; Headsman, a metal great axe +2,
  in the arena Announcer's stash. And the Elven Leader's Gythka +1 made +2.
- Weapons for those who had too few magic ones: Galefang, a metal dagger +2 of DSCLOG's own type
  that air clerics may use, on the Rogue Shaman; Mindshard, an obsidian short sword +1, on Maris,
  and Stillwater, a bone short sword +1, in the chest Chaya gives as her apology (psionicists',
  alone or with a cleric's); Linebreaker, a metal polearm +2, on the Troop Leader; Thornwall, a
  bone polearm +1, on the slave pens' weapon rack, in place of one of its two plain ones.
- Bracers of defense (DSCLOG's BRACERS type, worn on the arms: their plus counts for AC while neither
  armour nor a helm is worn), now that a preserver can't cast in armour: on four
  of the game's wizards, better the later they're met.

All of them are in the game's data (dataitems.py): the launcher writes them into their people's
and chests' objects in its copy of SEGOBJEX.GFF, by the Options tab's switches, so a new game
has them where the game makes those people and chests. People of a kind who share an object
(the Tari, Renegades, Wild Muls) each carry the item; one Castle Guard, one Undermountain miner
and one Magera have an object of their own for theirs (a copy of their kind's, and their region's entity
pointing to it, in the Ledger's copy of that region's file).
