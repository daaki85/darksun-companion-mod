"""The Ledger's new items written into the game's own data: each in the object it belongs to (a
person's, a chest's) in the Ledger's copy of SEGOBJEX.GFF, so that the game makes it with them.

An object's record (an RDFF chunk) is a list of records, each a header and its data:

- the object itself (level 1: a person, type 2; or an item, type 1, a chest);
- its items: the first a child of the object (level 2, its "of" the object's index, 0), each
  next one after the one before (level 4, its "of" that one's index), each an item record (type
  1, its 21 bytes as an item's in memory, its next item and contents left 0);
- after each item, its attributes (level 3, "of" the item's index): its item type (type 5, the
  number in the header's word) and its name (type 3);
- an end (level FFh).

The header's other word (the item's: the game's own items reuse a few hundred numbers, the same
for the same kind of item) is copied from an item of the same type, which the game does no more
with than carry along.

People of a kind share one object (six Castle Guards, four Undermountain miners): an item for one
of them alone needs an object of their own, a copy of the kind's under a new number (its record
naming itself), and the region's entity for that person (its ETAB entry) pointing to it, in the
Ledger's copy of the region's file.
