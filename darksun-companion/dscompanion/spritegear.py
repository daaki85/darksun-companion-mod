"""Worn equipment shown on a party member's map sprite, from where spriteparts finds the parts of
each frame (set by hand where finding them goes wrong). The artist's pixels are kept wherever they
can be: what is worn on the body recolours the character's own picture, what is carried is drawn
on it.

  * Weapons and shields: in a fight in the hands (each pose's grip set by hand); walking, a shield
    on the arm and a one-handed weapon worn at the belt like a scabbard; a bow and quiver on the
    back, a sling or chatkcha at the hip: drawn, in their material's colours.
  * Body armour (chest, arms, legs), boots and belts: the character's own clothing, feet or waist
    recoloured toward the material, shade for shade.
  * Helms: a circlet at the brow, blended into the hair under it.
  * Cloaks: the human and half-elf woman's own cloak, frame by frame, fitted to the wearer.

The colours are muted ones from the parts of the palette no region changes (30-79 and 128-222), so
the gear sits in the picture the way the game's own colours do. A thri-kreen shows only weapons and
shields (all it can use). armed() makes one frame.
