"""The party's map sprites with what each character wears (spritegear.py), in the running game.

The party are objects 300-313 (SEGOBJEX's OJFF chunks): object 300 + the figure picked at character
creation (the creature's +18h). An object's word +0Ch names its walking picture (a BMP chunk), its
combat picture the next chunk. In the Ledger's copy of SEGOBJEX (icons.write_objects) each of the
14 objects gets a pair of its own, SPRITE_BASE on: the game's own pictures with room round them
(gear sticks out), each with room kept free after it in the file (not in its length).

The game loads a picture from the file when it first needs it (DSUN.EXE 25FA6h), keeping it in a
table of the pictures it has (PICTURE_TABLE: 16 bytes each, +0 the picture's number, +2 its
length), and draws a figure's whole picture each time: so a picture's length is what drawing it
costs, and the Ledger's are exactly as long as they need be. When a party member's worn items
change, the Ledger writes their object's two pictures, dressed, over the old in its copy of the
file, with their new lengths in the file's index (where the game reads them each time it loads
one), takes the old ones out of the game's table (their number changed to STALE: the game frees
them itself, as any it no longer draws), and empties the member's slots on the map, so the game
loads the new ones and draws them at once (in a few milliseconds, as fast as writing them into
its memory).

Two party members of the same race and sex share an object, and the game loads a picture once and
draws everyone with it. So the copy also has a spare pair for each party place (SPARES, after the
14), each with room for any model: a member whose figure an earlier member already has is drawn in
the spare pair of their place. Each thing on the map (the table at MAP_ENTRIES, one entry per
combatant) names the picture it is drawn with (+18h, the walking one; its combat one is the next)
and the slot in the game's table it is drawn from (+0Fh). The Ledger names the member's spare
picture there and empties the slot, and the game loads the picture itself and draws them with it
at once. The same puts right a save from before the copy, whose party still names the game's own
pictures.
