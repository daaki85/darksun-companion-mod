"""The party's map sprites with what each character wears (spritegear.py), in the running game.

The party are objects 300-313 (SEGOBJEX's OJFF chunks): object 300 + the figure picked at character
creation (the creature's +18h). An object's word +0Ch names its walking picture (a BMP chunk), its
combat picture the next chunk. In the Ledger's copy of SEGOBJEX (icons.write_objects) each of the
14 objects gets a pair of its own, SPRITE_BASE on: the game's own pictures with room round them
(gear sticks out), in chunks of a fixed size with room to spare, a marker at the end of each.

While the game runs, when a party member's worn items change the Ledger rebuilds their object's
two pictures (the same size) and writes them over the copies the game has loaded (found by the
marker), and marks their things on the map changed (MAP_FLAGS), so the game draws them again at
once.

Two party members of the same race and sex share an object, and the game loads a picture once and
draws everyone with it from the same place in its picture cache. So the copy also has a spare pair
for each party place (SPARES, after the 14), each with room for any model: a member whose figure an
earlier member already has is drawn in the spare pair of their place. Each thing on the map (the
table at MAP_ENTRIES, one entry per combatant) names the picture it is drawn with (+18h, the
walking one; its combat one is the next) and the slot in the game's picture cache it is drawn from
(+0Fh). The Ledger names the member's spare picture there and empties the slot, and the game loads
the picture itself and draws them with it at once. The same puts right a save from before the copy,
whose party still names the game's own pictures.
