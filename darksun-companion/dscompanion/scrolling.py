"""Scrolling the map with the mouse (DSCLOG's SCROLLING), switched by the Ledger.

DSCLOG does the dragging: holding the wheel pressed (the middle button) and moving scrolls the
map with the pointer; so, if switched on, does holding the right button, a right click still
being the game's (walk, use, look). (DSCLOG's PAN_X and PAN_Y, which also scroll the map, are the
Tab-chosen enemy's: targeting.py.)
