"""No manual check: the dragon's question (the game's copy protection) taken out.

Leaving the sewers, the Tari's warrens (region 28h; script 120: "Do you want to leave the
sewers?"), until it has been answered there, the game runs script 20: a dragon "creates a
mindlink" and asks for a word from the manual ("The 3rd word on page 14, line 1, begins with
the letter 'p'. What is that word?"), one of twenty at random; three wrong answers and the
party dies. Answered, script 86 (at 1087) sets what the right answer sets: 255 in a variable
of the game's (7, 4), and, in that region (28h), the bit (12 of 135, 73) that script 120
tests to ask only once.

In the Ledger's copy of the scripts, script 20 does only that: no dragon, no question. It
starts at the same place (1, after its first command), the one entry point the game's table
has for it, so a save made anywhere goes on the same way.
