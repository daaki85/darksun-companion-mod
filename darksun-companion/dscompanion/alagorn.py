"""Alagorn tells of the Ledger's magic items: Kreenfang and Shadowseeker (arms.py), Gutterknot,
Deepbiter, Windlash, Greenbright and the Flame Blade, the Warden's Plate, the Cloak and Boots of
Elvenkind, the Bracers of Defense, Arrowbane and the Sunking Crown (worldgear.py), and the Tome of
Understanding (tome.py), Inixhide (npcitems.py), and the Rings and Cloak of Protection (ring.py,
npcitems.py): one story for each kind, whichever of it the party carries, as the game's own.

Alagorn, the wizard wandering the Painted Badlands, identifies magic items from menus by kind:
magic swords, magic weapons, fruit and wands (script 213); rings, armour, shields, necklaces,
clothes and other items (script 212). Each kind's part sees which of the items he knows the party
carries (a local for each, from a query on the item's picture: the Bloodwrath's is -1576), says
there are none, or shows a menu of those, one reply each; a reply's story clears its local, and
when none is left (a local of the script's: DONE) the menu's loop ends.

With the Ledger, Shadowseeker, Greenbright and the Flame Blade join the swords, Kreenfang,
Gutterknot, Deepbiter and Windlash the weapons, Inixhide and the Warden's Plate's four pieces the
armour, the Cloak and Boots of Elvenkind, the bracers, Arrowbane, the crown and the cloak of
protection the clothes (where the game has its Helm of Contemplation and Chameleon Gloves), the
rings of protection the rings, and the tome the other items, by their pictures of their own
(icons.py: without the icons' copy he doesn't know them; the tome's, its object's), each only
with its content switch on. As pensasks.py does, nothing
of the game's script moves: commands of it become jumps (64h) to code put after the script's end,
which jumps back:

- each kind's first test for none carried (the tests just before "none"): the new items' locals
  set too, then the game's tests again, the new items counted in the last: none carried goes on
  to "no magic swords" / "no magic weapons"..., any to where the game's test goes;
- the kind's menu: a copy with the new items' replies after the game's last;
- each of the kind's stories' test for none left: the new items counted too.

The new stories are subroutines, as the game's replies are.
