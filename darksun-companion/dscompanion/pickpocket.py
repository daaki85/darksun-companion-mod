"""Picking pockets: the party leader, a thief, tries the pocket of whoever they're talking to.

The game has one pickpocket of its own, the Trustee's key in the slave pens, in his script.
With the dice log's patched game, P in any conversation (DSCLOG's PROBE_PICK) has the Ledger
roll the leader's pick pockets chance as it stands now (thief_skills_now). On a success the
thief lifts one small thing (weight 10 or less, and nothing worn on the body) from the
person into the backpack. On a failure, a move silently roll decides whether they got away
unnoticed. With nothing else on them, the thief takes a few coins (party money), and that is
the last try on them. A thief can go on trying the same person until caught (both rolls
failed) or until they take the coins; after that, their pockets are out of reach.
