"""PAGE 1 and PAGE 2 buttons in the save/load window (DSCLOG's PROBE_SAVE_PAGE).

The game's save/load window (WIND 3009 in RESOURCE.GFF) shows ten saves. DSCLOG shows ten more
(SAVB01.SAV to SAVB10.SAV) for PgDn, or a click on PAGE 2, and the game's own for PgUp or PAGE 1.
The buttons are the game's kind: a button (BUTN) placed in the window, under EXIT, and its four
pictures (ICON: as it is, the pointer over it, out of use, pressed) made from EXIT's, its letters
taken away and the page's put in, in the game's text font (FONT 100: the buttons' own carved
letters have no P, G or digits) and in EXIT's letters' colours. They go in the Ledger's copy of
RESOURCE.GFF (icons.write_resources); the page shown is out of use (DSCLOG).
