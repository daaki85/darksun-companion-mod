"""Names for the companion's own items, past the game's own 322 in its name table.

The game reads its item names (GPLDATA's NAME chunk: 322 of 25 bytes, numbered 0-321) into
memory as it starts and as each game is loaded; an item names its entry by number, and nothing
in the game checks that number against 322. The patched game has DSCLOG reserve room for
NAMES_EXTRA more each time and copy its own names into them (PROBE_NAMES_SIZE and
PROBE_NAMES_FILL), noting where in its header (names_ptr). The companion's items name those
entries (from OWN on: RING, TOOLS), so they take nothing of the game's.

Earlier versions borrowed two of the game's entries instead: one nothing used (the ring's) and
the label of the rest button's icon (the tools'). Their items get today's entries (migrate),
and the entries go back to what the game has there (restore).
