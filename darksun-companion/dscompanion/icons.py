"""Inventory icons of the companion's own for its items, made the way the game makes its magic
items' (the Bloodwrath's is the obsidian long sword's with a few pixels in the colours the game
cycles: 240-248, fire): from the plain item's icon.

- the Short Sword: the metal long sword's, its blade four steps shorter, centred;
- Leather Chest Armor +1: the leather's brightest pixels in the fire colours;
- the Cloak of Protection +1: every other pixel of its lightest folds in the violet ones (232-239);
- the Rings of Protection +1: the gold band violet for Pehtucl's, in the fire colours for the
  arena's (the Tied-up Prisoner's), so the two can be told apart.

- the Bone Helm (bonescale.py): the leather Helm's, each shade of leather made the bone scale
  armour's of the same brightness (BONE).
- Kreenfang (arms.py, the arena's Gythka +1): the bone gythka's, its two blades in the fire colours;
- Shadowseeker (arms.py, Kurzak's Short Sword +1): the Short Sword's, its blade night steel (dark
  blue-greys).

Violet is 35-37 of the palette, which no region changes (232-239, violet in RESOURCE.GFF's
palette, are each region's own: red in the slave pens).

The game reads object pictures from SEGOBJEX.GFF. The game folder is never changed: the launcher
writes a copy of that file next to the patched game (the dos folder, D: in DOSBox) with an
object added for each of these icons, and DSCLOG has the game open the copy instead (its INT
21h hook, PROBE_DOS_OPEN).
An object (OJFF) is an item's picture number negated; its word +0Ch names its icon (a BMP chunk),
and a BMP chunk of its own number is its picture on the map, here the plain item's.
