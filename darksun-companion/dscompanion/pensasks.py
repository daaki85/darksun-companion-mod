"""Dinos and the Trustee asked about Kalzith and Semyon.

Both of the game's people answer questions about the others in the pens from a menu ("What do you
know about Gilal?", "What can you tell me about Dinos?"); with the Ledger, the same menus also ask
about Kalzith once the Ledger has found him in the pens (kalzith.py), and about Semyon while he
is in his pen (semyon.py). As the game's own, a question isn't shown again once answered in that
talk.

Nothing of the game's scripts moves (their jumps go to fixed offsets): two of their commands
become jumps (64h) to code put after the script's end. The one starting the menu's part, which
clears the menu's local, goes to a piece doing that, then setting the questions' flags, and
jumping back; the menu itself goes to a copy of it (the game's own bytes) with the new questions
after its last about someone, followed by a jump on to what comes after the game's menu. The
answers are subroutines, as the game's are.

The Trustee's script is then longer than the game's buffer for scripts allows (10000 bytes,
less some): the Ledger's copy of the game has a bigger one (gamepatch.SCRIPT_BUFFER).
