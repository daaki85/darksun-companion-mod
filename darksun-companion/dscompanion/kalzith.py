"""Kalzith, a defiler in the slave pens who sells spell scrolls to a party that treats him well.

He is a slave the templars put in the arena now and then (the crowd loves to watch a defiler burn),
kept in a pen of his own the rest of the time; he has the look of the arena's Defiler, but the
party has never fought him. He secretly scribes spells on scraps of hide, to buy a guard's blind eye; a preserver can learn from them (the game's own scrolls: right-click one, click
its spell). Insult him or threaten to report him and he won't trade until the party makes amends:
50 ceramic pieces, or a Charisma check. Killed, he leaves one of his scrolls at random, a Cloak and
a Quarterstaff (loot).

He is the game's own kind of person, added to the Ledger's copies of three of its files (the game
folder is never changed; DSCLOG has the game open the copies):

  * SEGOBJEX.GFF: object OBJECT, his OJFF (a person's, with the arena Defiler's picture) and
    RDFF (a slave's record, Dinos's, with his name and a defiler's class);
  * RGN29.GFF, the slave pens: an entry in its entity table (ETAB) setting him in his pen (PEN);
  * GPLDATA.GFF: his conversation, script SCRIPT, and in the pens' master script (MAS 41) the
    command that runs it when the party talks to him (6Eh, as for Dinos and the rest), with its
    entry in the game's table of entry points (GPLI, which saves go by); and his
    portrait, PORTRAIT: the game's PORTRAIT_FROM with an X branded on the brow, so that no one
    else's face is his (the Ledger's dialogue tab shows it too).

The game reads the pens' people from RGN29 only the first time the party goes there (a save keeps
them as they were), so he is in new games: those started after the Ledger has these copies.
His stock, the six scrolls in SCROLLS, the Ledger puts among his things once a game (stock), as it
does the slave-pen items (npcitems); the game's shop screen (24h) sells what he carries.
