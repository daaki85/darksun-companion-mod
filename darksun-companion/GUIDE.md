# Obsidian Edition: the player's guide

How **Dark Sun: Shattered Lands** plays with the Obsidian Edition mod: making
a party, the classes and kits, fighting, magic, psionics, equipment and levels, with
the tables you need.

It is **spoiler-free**: no places past the opening arena, no people, no
quests, and no word of where any item is found (the mod's new items are listed
by what they are).

Everything here is the mod with its **default options**, which is how the
Ledger starts. Every rule change has a switch on the Ledger's **Options** tab
([at a glance](#the-options-tab-at-a-glance)); where it helps to know what a
switch changes, a **Without the mod** note says what the game does with it off.
The [README](README.md) has every rule in full detail.

## Getting started

1. Unzip the mod anywhere and double-click **`Start Obsidian Edition.bat`**
   (the first time, it offers to install Python; see the
   [README](README.md#running-it-windows)).
2. Press **Start the game**. The game opens beside the Ledger, whose dice log
   shows every roll as it happens.
3. Make your own party (**CREATE CHARACTERS**): weapon specs and kits are
   chosen when a character is made, so the four the game offers have none.

## Playing

The pointer has three modes, changed with a right-click: **Walk**, **Attack**
and **Look**; a left-click acts. Look at someone to **Talk**, at a thing to
**Use** or **Pick Up** it, and at a monster in a fight to see what the Ledger
tells of it. Resting at a fire ring fills hit points, PSP and spell slots.

The [quality of life changes](#quality-of-life) list what the mod makes
easier.

## Quality of life

**In the game:**

| Change | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Tab and Enter** | On a party member's turn in a fight, **Tab** chooses the nearest enemy (Tab again for the next, **Shift+Tab** back) and **Enter** attacks it, walking up to it first if need be, even behind someone else: no aiming with the mouse. A red ring marks the enemy chosen (or, on the Options tab, every enemy). |
| **Scrolling with the mouse** | Press the wheel and drag the map. Optionally, hold the right button and drag. |
| **40 saves** | Four pages of ten in the save and load window (**PAGE 1** to **PAGE 4**, or **PgUp** and **PgDn**). *Without the mod:* 10. |
| **29 characters on disk** | The roster keeps 29 characters made with CREATE CHARACTERS. *Without the mod:* 19. |
| **DELETE in the roster** | Deletes the character you chose. *Without the mod:* with the list scrolled, it deleted another one. |
| **New characters' thief skills** | A character not yet played shows its thief skills. *Without the mod:* they showed as 0. |
| **Spells on the Effects screen** | A stray click on a spell's icon no longer ends the spell. A psionic power's icon still ends the power, which is how you stop one. |
| **No copy protection** | The question from the manual never comes. |
| **THAC0, saves and thief skills on screen** | The inventory screen shows THAC0, all five saves, THAC0 with each weapon, DEX's adjustments and a thief's skills; View Character shows THAC0 and the saves, and for a character of several classes which class goes up next. |
| **Spell slots on the USE screen** | Spells left of each level, and the most after resting. |
| **The Look box** | In a fight, a monster's hit points, AC, THAC0, alignment, magic resistance and chief defence; closing the box tells the rest. |
| **Item boxes** | A wand's or other charged item's charges left; a cloak's, boots' or belt's bonus to thief skills. |
| **The Effects screen** | Names each kit and weapon spec, a page at a time when there are many. |
| **Each turn's rolls** (off unless ticked) | At the end of each turn in a fight, its rolls in the game's own window: at the least, in short or in detail. |
| **Game speed** | DOSBox runs the game faster than GOG's settings (choose GOG's own, faster or fastest), so the party walks smoothly with shadows and dust. |
| **Game window** | Double, triple or quadruple size, or full screen, chosen at the top of the Ledger. |
| **On the map** | The party's figures show what they wear, everyone casts a shadow, and walkers raise dust (each can be switched off). |
| **Crash reports** | If the game or DOSBox stops with an error, the message stays on screen and the Ledger writes a report to send. |

**In the Ledger's window:**

- **The dice log:** every roll as it happens, with what it needed and where
  each bonus came from; **Save...** keeps it as a text file.
- **Characters:** each character's sheet as the game's View Character lays it
  out, with THAC0 by weapon, saves, attacks a round, what they wear, spell
  slots and thief skills.
- **Dialogue:** everything said, with the speaker and the replies offered.
- **Spells:** every spell's and psionic power's dice, saves, effects and
  duration, and each party member's caster level for it.
- **Text size** (**A+** and **A-**, or Ctrl + and Ctrl −) and keyboard access to
  everything.
- **`Play Dark Sun (in-game rolls).bat`** plays with all of the above in the
  game but no Ledger window; **`Show Save.bat`** shows the party in a save file.

## Making a party

On the main menu choose **CREATE CHARACTERS**, right-click an empty slot and
choose **NEW**. Click the portrait for race and sex, mark one to three classes,
choose a cleric's or ranger's sphere and an alignment, click the die to roll,
and press **DONE**. The panel under the classes has the mod's pages: **WEAPON
SPEC** for warriors ([weapon specialization](#weapon-specialization-and-attacks))
and **KITS** ([kits](#kits)). A party has one to four characters, all good or
neutral.

### Ability scores

Each click of the die rolls a whole character:

- Each score is rolled **four times as 4d4 + 4** and the best kept (8 to 20),
  then the race's adjustment is added.
- A score below the classes' minimum is raised to it: **17 in the prime
  requisite**, otherwise **9** (clerics, fighters, preservers, thieves), **12**
  (druids, psionicists), **13** (gladiators) or **14** (rangers). A character
  of several classes takes the highest minimum of each score.
- **What the die gives is what you get.** A score can be lowered with a right
  click, and the points freed raise others with a left click, but the six
  never add up to more than the die gave. Under CHR, `SUM:99/101` is what
  they add up to now and the most they may: 2 points to spare. A new class
  that raises a score to its minimum raises the most with it. *Without the
  mod:* a click raises any score to its most.

| Class | Prime requisite |
|---|---|
| Fighter, gladiator | STR |
| Cleric, druid, psionicist, ranger | WIS |
| Preserver | INT |
| Thief | DEX |

What the scores do:

- **STR:** to-hit and damage in melee, and how much is carried.
- **DEX:** AC (−1 at 15, down to −6 at 24), to-hit with missiles,
  [initiative](#initiative), thief skills, the
  [two-weapon penalty](#two-weapons), and dodging fire, cold and electricity
  ([saving throws](#saving-throws)).
- **CON:** hit points, saves against paralysis, poison and death; at 20 or
  more, a hit point comes back now and then.
- **INT:** for preservers, the chance to learn a spell from a scroll and how
  many spells of each level they can know
  ([learning spells](#learning-preserver-spells)).
- **WIS:** priests' bonus spell slots, and saves against mind-affecting magic.
- **CHA:** how some people take to the party, and the **party leader's**
  CHA lowers what shops ask, as in Baldur's Gate:

  | Leader's CHA | 15 or less | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 20 or more |
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
  | Shops ask | full price | 5% less | 10% less | 15% less | 20% less | 25% less |

  Selling is unchanged. *Without the mod:* CHA makes no difference to prices.

### Races

| Race | STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Human | | | | | | | one class at a time, but can change class |
| Dwarf | +1 | −1 | +2 | | | −2 | better CON saves |
| Elf | | +2 | −2 | +1 | −1 | | |
| Half-elf | | +1 | −1 | | | | |
| Half-giant | +4 | −5 | +2 | −5 | −3 | −3 | double hit dice; holds a two-handed weapon in one hand |
| Halfling | −2 | +2 | −1 | | +2 | −1 | better CON saves |
| Mul | +2 | | +1 | −1 | | −2 | |
| Thri-kreen | | +2 | | −1 | +1 | −2 | base AC 5, moves 15 (others 12); no armour, cloaks, belts, boots or rings |

With each score rolled 8 to 20 before the adjustment, a race's scores run from
8 to 20 plus its adjustment: a half-giant's STR 12 to 24, its DEX and INT 3 to
15, its WIS and CHA 5 to 17. (The Dark Sun book caps a half-giant's DEX and
INT at 15 and its WIS and CHA at 17, with smaller adjustments; the game gets
the same caps from these larger ones.)

**Classes by race** (the creation screen greys the rest):

| Race | Cleric | Druid | Fighter | Gladiator | Preserver | Psionicist | Ranger | Thief |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Human | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Dwarf | ✓ | | ✓ | ✓ | | ✓ | | ✓ |
| Elf | ✓ | | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Half-elf | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Half-giant | ✓ | | ✓ | ✓ | | ✓ | ✓ | |
| Halfling | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Mul | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | | ✓ | | ✓ |
| Thri-kreen | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | | ✓ | ✓ | |

**Alignment:** a druid must be true neutral, a ranger good (lawful, neutral
or chaotic good). The others may be any good or neutral alignment.

### More than one class

**Multiclass (any race but human).** A character takes two or three classes
at once. Experience is split evenly between them, so each rises more slowly;
hit points are shared out ([hit points](#hit-points)); and the strictest
class decides what may be worn and wielded
([what each class may use](#what-each-class-may-use)). **Gladiators never
multiclass.** Each class's section below lists its combinations and the races
that can take them; in all:

| Race | Two classes | Three classes |
|---|---|---|
| Dwarf | cleric/fighter, cleric/psionicist, fighter/psionicist, fighter/thief, psionicist/thief | cleric/fighter/psionicist, fighter/psionicist/thief |
| Elf | any two of cleric, fighter, preserver, psionicist, ranger and thief but fighter/ranger | any three of them without both fighter and ranger |
| Half-elf | as the elf, and a druid with fighter, preserver, psionicist or thief | as the elf, and a druid with any two of fighter, preserver, psionicist and thief |
| Half-giant | cleric/fighter, cleric/psionicist, cleric/ranger, fighter/psionicist, psionicist/ranger | none |
| Halfling | cleric or druid with fighter, psionicist or thief (and cleric/ranger); fighter/psionicist, fighter/thief, psionicist/ranger, psionicist/thief, ranger/thief | fighter/psionicist/thief, psionicist/ranger/thief |
| Mul | cleric or druid with fighter, psionicist or thief; fighter/psionicist, fighter/thief, psionicist/thief | cleric/fighter/thief, druid/fighter/thief, fighter/psionicist/thief |
| Thri-kreen | cleric or druid with fighter or psionicist; cleric/ranger, fighter/psionicist, psionicist/ranger | cleric/fighter/psionicist, cleric/psionicist/ranger, druid/fighter/psionicist |

No character is both cleric and druid, nor two of fighter, gladiator and
ranger.

**Dual class (humans only).** A human has one class, and can change to another
with **DUAL** on a portrait's right-click menu when:

- it is **2nd level or more** and has changed class at most once before;
- its **current class's prime requisite is 15 or more**, and the **new
  class's 17 or more**;
- the new class is of **another group** than every class it has had: priests
  (cleric, druid), warriors (fighter, gladiator, ranger), preserver,
  psionicist, thief;
- its alignment suits the new class (a druid true neutral, a ranger good).

The new class starts at 1st level. The old class stops rising, and what it
gives (its hit points, THAC0, saves, weapon specs and kit) **sleeps until the
new class's level passes the old one's**; then both count. The new class can
take a kit of its own, so a human may end up with three. Some kits rule out
classes a human could change to ([kits](#kits)).

### Hit points

| Class | Hit die | At 10th level |
|---|---|---|
| Fighter, gladiator, ranger | d10 | +3 |
| Cleric, druid | d8 | +2 |
| Psionicist | d6 | +2 |
| Thief | d6 | d6 |
| Preserver | d4 | d4 |

- **Every hit die is rolled twice and the better kept,** at creation (one die
  for every starting level) and at every level up. *Without the mod:* one roll.
- **The hit points are as rolled:** clicking them on the creation screen does
  nothing. *Without the mod:* a click sets them anywhere the dice could have.
- Half-giants roll double. A roll counts at least 2 with CON 20, 3 with CON
  21-22 and 4 with CON 23 or more.
- **CON's bonus** comes with every level: for a fighter, gladiator or ranger
  +1 at CON 15, +2 at 16, +3 at 17, +4 at 18, +5 at 19-20, +6 at 21-23 and +7 at
  24-25 (−1 at 4-6); for anyone else at most +2.
- **A character of several classes** gets each class's die divided by the
  number of classes (at least 1), and CON's bonus divided too. *Without the
  mod:* the dice are added and the total divided, and CON's bonus is whole.
- Three [kits](#kits) have a die of their own.
- At 0 hit points a character is Out Cold; at −10, dead.

### THAC0 by level

AD&D's tables; a character of several classes uses its best.

| Level | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Fighter, gladiator, ranger | 20 | 19 | 18 | 17 | 16 | 15 | 14 | 13 | 12 | 11 |
| Cleric, druid | 20 | 20 | 20 | 18 | 18 | 18 | 16 | 16 | 16 | 14 |
| Thief | 20 | 20 | 19 | 19 | 18 | 18 | 17 | 17 | 16 | 16 |
| Psionicist | 20 | 20 | 19 | 19 | 18 | 18 | 17 | 17 | 16 | 16 |
| Preserver | 20 | 20 | 20 | 19 | 19 | 19 | 18 | 18 | 18 | 17 |

*Without the mod:* clerics and druids improve by about 2/3 a level (19 at
3rd, 17 at 6th, 15 at 9th); the rest are as above.

## The classes

| Class | Hit die | Prime requisite | Races | Armour | Weapons | Kits |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Fighter](#fighter) | d10 | STR | all | any | any | Myrmidon, Sentinel, Ravager |
| [Gladiator](#gladiator) | d10 | STR | all | any | any | Arena Champion, Twin-blade, Brute |
| [Ranger](#ranger) | d10 | WIS | not dwarf, mul | any | any | Stalker, Seeker, Justifier |
| [Thief](#thief) | d6 | DEX | not half-giant, thri-kreen | any (light with another class) | any | Assassin, Swashbuckler, Shinobi |
| [Preserver](#preserver) | d4 | INT | elf, half-elf, human | none | daggers, staves, slings | Arcanist, Scholar, Battle Mage |
| [Cleric](#cleric) | d8 | WIS | all | any | its sphere's | Healer, Crusader, Elementalist |
| [Druid](#druid) | d8 | WIS | half-elf, halfling, human, mul, thri-kreen | none | any but great axes | Grove Warden, Wanderer, Lifebinder |
| [Psionicist](#psionicist) | d6 | WIS | all | light | small weapons | Mind Warrior, Mind Bender, Kineticist |

The [THAC0](#thac0-by-level) and [experience](#experience-and-levels) tables
cover every class; [new items](#new-items) lists what the mod adds to find.

### What each class may use

A character may use an item only if **every** one of its classes allows it,
the strictest winning:

| Class | Armour and helms | Shields | Weapons |
|---|---|---|---|
| Psionicist, whatever its other classes | light only (leather, hide, silk) | leather only | daggers, short swords, maces, clubs, chatkchas, bows and slings (as the game's lists allow) |
| Thief with another class | light only | a leather one, if another class allows shields | as its classes allow |
| Preserver, one class | none | none | a preserver's |
| Druid | none | none | any |
| Cleric | any | any | air: missile and thrown weapons, daggers; earth: stone, obsidian, metal, wood; fire: obsidian; water: bone, wood |

- A preserver with another class may wear what that class allows, but casts
  no spells while wearing armour (a helm counts, a shield doesn't). Bracers
  of defense aren't armour.
- A ranger may always use a bow.
- A human who changed class is held by its new class, but may use the kinds
  of weapon it specialized in once its old class wakes.

*Without the mod:* an item was allowed if **any** of the character's classes
allowed it, and a preserver with another class cast in armour.

Each class's section lists the magic weapons it can wield, the mod's new ones
marked \*. A plain weapon of each kind and material is listed as "bone short
sword" and the like.

### Fighter

*d10 · STR · any race · XP for 2nd level 2,000, for 10th 500,000*

**How it plays.** The steadiest front-liner: any armour, any shield, any
weapon, the best THAC0, and it masters one kind of weapon. Choose that kind
with care: it is the fighter's weapon for the whole game.

**What the mod changes.**

- [Weapon specialization](#weapon-specialization-and-attacks): one kind of
  weapon, +1 to hit and +2 damage with 3/2 attacks a round; **mastery** at 5th
  level (+3 and +3), **grand mastery** at 9th (the damage die a size larger and
  one more attack). Other weapons attack once a round until 7th level.
  *Without the mod:* 3/2 attacks with any weapon, no other bonus.
- Up to 10th level; hit dice rolled twice.
- [Two weapons](#two-weapons) cost to-hit, and the off hand attacks once a round.

**Weapons and armour.** Everything. A fighter with other classes is held to
theirs ([what each class may use](#what-each-class-may-use)).

**Kits.**

*Myrmidon.* Drilled in a sorcerer-king's legions, where a soldier who falls out
of step is left for the kanks. They master two weapons where others master one,
but years of obeying orders leave their minds open to anyone who barks them.

*Sentinel.* Caravan guards and city-gate wardens who live behind their shields,
first to see the raiders coming and last to give ground. They trust bone and
obsidian over sorcery, and spells bite them harder for it.

*Ravager.* Raiders of the wastes who fight half-naked under the crimson sun,
scarred hide hardening with every season. They charge in close and stay there:
bows, slings and shields are for those who mean to live long.

| Kit | Gives | Costs | Starts with |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Myrmidon** | a second weapon spec at 1st level, on to mastery as the first | −4 on saves against charms | the fighter's gear, and a plain weapon of its second weapon spec in the backpack |
| **Sentinel** | AC 2 better with a shield; +2 initiative | −1 on saves against wizards' and priests' spells | the fighter's gear |
| **Ravager** | +1 to hit and damage in melee; a base AC by level (7 at 1st-2nd, 6 at 3rd-4th, 5 at 5th-6th, 4 at 7th-8th, 3 at 9th-10th), armour bettering it as usual | no missile or thrown weapons; no shield; leather armour or none | the fighter's gear with a second of its weapon in place of the shield (none if the weapon takes both hands) |

A Sentinel can't later become a druid or preserver, nor take the Shinobi kit
as a thief.

**Starting gear.** A plain weapon of its weapon spec (in a material its
classes allow), a shield, leather chest, arm and leg armour.

**More than one class.**

- *Multiclass:* cleric/fighter (all but humans); druid/fighter (half-elf,
  halfling, mul, thri-kreen); fighter/preserver (elf, half-elf);
  fighter/psionicist (all but humans); fighter/thief (dwarf, elf, half-elf,
  halfling, mul); cleric/fighter/preserver (elf, half-elf);
  cleric/fighter/psionicist (dwarf, elf, half-elf, thri-kreen);
  cleric/fighter/thief (elf, half-elf, mul); druid/fighter/preserver
  (half-elf); druid/fighter/psionicist (half-elf, thri-kreen);
  druid/fighter/thief (half-elf, mul); fighter/preserver/psionicist and
  fighter/preserver/thief (elf, half-elf); fighter/psionicist/thief (dwarf,
  elf, half-elf, halfling, mul).
- *Dual class:* with STR 15, a human fighter can become a cleric, druid,
  preserver, psionicist or thief, never a gladiator or ranger. Its weapon specs
  sleep with the class; once awake, its specialized kinds stay usable whatever
  the new class allows.

**Magic weapons.** Every one: Dragonsbane +4, Swiftbite +2, El's Drinker +2,
Dark Flame +2, Draketooth +1, Hornblade +1, Bloodwrath +1, Flame Blade\* +1;
Greenbright\* +2, Shadowseeker\* +1, Mindshard\* +1, Stillwater\* +1; Dag's
Dagger +3, Terror Blade +2, Galefang\* +2; Glasshewer\* +2, Drakejaw\* +1,
Soulcrusher +1, Axe +1; Great Axe +3, Headsman\* +2; Gythka +3, Gythka +2\*,
Kreenfang\* +1; Linebreaker\* +2, Polearm +1, Thornwall\* +1; Mace +2,
Blackmace +1; Quarterstaff +2, Balk's Staff +1, Parting Staff +1;
Gutterknot\* +1; Deepbiter\* +1; Cahulaks +1; Bow +2, Phrain's Bow +1; Sling +2,
Sling +1; Windlash\* +1; Chatkcha +1. A **Ravager** none of the bows, slings,
Windlash, Chatkcha +1 or Dag's Dagger (thrown).

### Gladiator

*d10 · STR · any race · XP for 2nd level 2,250, for 10th 600,000*

**How it plays.** The arena's finest: trained in many weapons rather than one,
better AC as it rises, and the most varied kits. A gladiator is **always a
single class** (a human may still change class).

**What the mod changes.**

- [Weapon specialization](#weapon-specialization-and-attacks) in **two** kinds
  at 1st level, a third at 6th and a fourth at 9th: +1 to hit, +2 damage and
  3/2 attacks with each. *Without the mod:* 3/2 attacks with any weapon.
- AC 1 better from 5th level and 2 better at 10th, with or without armour.
- AD&D's experience table. *Without the mod:* the fighter's.
- Up to 10th level; hit dice rolled twice.

**Weapons and armour.** Everything.

**Kits.**

*Arena Champion.* Crowd favourites of the fighting pits, schooled to turn every
blow with a shield and answer it before the cheering dies. Without one they
feel naked on the sand, and fight like it.

*Twin-blade.* Showfighters who carry a weapon in each hand and make the crowd
count the blows. They have no use for a shield, nor for a weapon so heavy it
needs both hands.

*Brute.* Pit fighters bought for size and fed for strength, swinging great axes
and mauls that end a bout in one blow. Anything smaller looks like a toy in
their hands, and they treat it like one.

| Kit | Gives | Costs | Starts with |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Arena Champion** | with a shield: +1 to hit and damage in melee, and AC 1 better | −1 to hit in melee without a shield | a shield in place of the off-hand club |
| **Twin-blade** | no penalty for two weapons | no shield; no two-handed weapon | its weapon and the club as its two weapons |
| **Brute** | +2 to hit and damage with a two-handed melee weapon | two-handed melee weapons only | a two-handed weapon (a bone great axe without weapon specialization); the club is left behind |

An Arena Champion can't later become a druid or preserver, a Brute a
psionicist or air cleric. Neither goes with the Shinobi kit, a Brute not with
the Lifebinder, a Twin-blade not with the Healer.

**Starting gear.** A plain weapon of its first weapon spec, a club in the off
hand, leather arm armour.

**More than one class.**

- *Multiclass:* none.
- *Dual class:* with STR 15, a human gladiator can become a cleric, druid,
  preserver, psionicist or thief.

**Magic weapons.** Every one ([the fighter's list](#fighter)). A
**Twin-blade** none of the two-handed ones (great axes, gythkas, polearms,
quarterstaffs, cahulaks, bows, staff sling); a **Brute** only Great Axe +3,
Headsman\*, the gythkas, the polearms, the quarterstaffs and Cahulaks +1 in
melee, and any missile weapon.

### Ranger

*d10 · WIS · elf, half-elf, half-giant, halfling, human, thri-kreen · good
alignment · XP for 2nd level 2,250, for 10th 600,000*

**How it plays.** A warrior of the wastes: the bow and one more kind of
weapon, two weapons at no penalty, hiding and moving silently under the open
sky to strike from behind, and a little priest magic late on.

**What the mod changes.**

- [Expertise](#weapon-specialization-and-attacks) with the bow and one more
  kind: a specialist's attacks a round. *Without the mod:* 3/2 in melee with
  any weapon.
- [Hiding in shadows](#hiding-in-shadows) in a fight with a thief's numbers for
  its level, halved indoors; a successful hide and move silently makes its next
  attack from behind.
- Priest spells of its sphere from 8th level, cast as a priest of its level
  less 7 for damage and duration too (1 slot at 8th, 2 at 9th, 2 and 1 at
  10th). *Without the mod:* cast at its full level.
- AD&D's experience table (2,250 for 2nd level; *without the mod:* 2,200).
- Up to 10th level; hit dice rolled twice.

**Weapons and armour.** Everything; any multiclass ranger keeps the bow
whatever its other classes allow.

**Kits.**

*Stalker.* Hunters of the scrub and the city's shadowed alleys alike, moving
where no one is watching and striking before anyone knows they are there. Heavy
armour would only slow them down and give them away.

*Seeker.* Wanderers on a lifelong pilgrimage through the wastes, looking for
the spirit that still lives in Athas's broken land. As they come to understand
it, the elements begin to answer them, though only through the arms a priest
would carry.

*Justifier.* Hunters hired to deal with whatever is too dangerous for anyone
else: a tribe's chieftain, a defiler's lair, a beast that has emptied a
village. They train their weapons to a killer's edge and leave prayer to
others.

| Kit | Gives | Costs | Starts with |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Stalker** | +2 movement in a fight; +15 to hide in shadows and move silently, and hiding not halved indoors | leather armour or none | the ranger's gear |
| **Seeker** | priest spells from 6th level, cast at its level less 5 | its sphere's weapons only, as a cleric's (but it keeps the bow) | the ranger's gear, its weapon in a material its sphere allows |
| **Justifier** | its expertise becomes specialization (+1 to hit, +2 damage) | its only spell slot is one 1st-level slot, from 10th level | the ranger's gear |

A Seeker or Justifier can't later become a cleric or druid.

**Starting gear.** A plain weapon of its chosen kind, bow and arrows, leather
chest and arm armour.

**More than one class.**

- *Multiclass:* cleric/ranger and psionicist/ranger (elf, half-elf,
  half-giant, halfling, thri-kreen); preserver/ranger (elf, half-elf);
  ranger/thief (elf, half-elf, halfling); cleric/preserver/ranger,
  cleric/ranger/thief, preserver/psionicist/ranger, preserver/ranger/thief
  (elf, half-elf); cleric/psionicist/ranger (elf, half-elf, thri-kreen);
  psionicist/ranger/thief (elf, half-elf, halfling).
- *Dual class:* with WIS 15, a human ranger can become a cleric, preserver,
  psionicist or thief (a druid must be neutral, a ranger good). A human of
  another class with WIS 17 and a good alignment can become a ranger.

**Magic weapons.** Every one ([the fighter's list](#fighter)). A **Seeker**
only its sphere's, and every bow: air, the daggers, bows, slings, Windlash\*,
Chatkcha +1; earth, the metal, obsidian, stone and wooden ones (no bone, no
slings);
fire, the obsidian ones and the bows; water, the bone and wooden ones.

### Thief

*d6 · DEX · not half-giant or thri-kreen · XP for 2nd level 1,250, for 10th
160,000*

**How it plays.** Locks, traps and pockets out of a fight; in one, it waits
for a clear turn, slips into the shadows and backstabs. Light on hit points,
so keep it off the front line.

**What the mod changes.**

- [Thief skills](#thieves-skills-and-picking-pockets) from AD&D's table with
  Dark Sun's race and DEX adjustments. *Without the mod:* the game's own,
  much higher, with penalties for what is held.
- [Hiding in shadows](#hiding-in-shadows) in a fight to backstab, halved in
  daylight. *Without the mod:* backstabs only when the target faces someone
  else. A backstab does ×2 damage at levels 1-4, ×3 at 5-8, ×4 at 9-10.
- **Picking pockets** with Thieves' Tools, from anyone in sight.
- A worn cloak, boots and belt help hiding, moving silently, picking pockets
  and opening locks.
- AD&D's experience table (1,250 for 2nd level; *without the mod:* 1,200).
- Up to 10th level, a d6 at 10th; hit dice rolled twice.

**Weapons and armour.** Any as a single class (but only a weapon no heavier
than a long sword backstabs, see [Equipment](#equipment)); with another class,
light armour and at most a leather shield.

**Kits.**

*Assassin.* Knives for hire in the templars' cities, where a noble house pays
well to see a rival fall. They learn to vanish in the full glare of the sun,
and leave locks and purses to lesser thieves.

*Swashbuckler.* Swaggering rogues of the merchant houses and the elven markets,
as handy with a blade as any soldier. All that time spent fighting leaves
little for the quieter arts.

*Shinobi.* Spies trained in secret by the Veiled Alliance, who carry a few
spells beside their knives. Their masters teach them only what they need; they
are unable to read magical script, however, and travel light.

| Kit | Gives | Costs | Starts with |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Assassin** | hiding in shadows not halved in daylight | −15 to pick pockets and open locks | the thief's gear |
| **Swashbuckler** | a warrior's THAC0 | −10 to every thief skill | the thief's gear |
| **Shinobi** | preserver spells from 6th level, from its own list of 14, cast at its thief level less 5, in light armour too | no spells from scrolls; dagger, short sword, quarterstaff, chatkcha, sling, staff sling and bow only; light armour; no shield | a bone short sword in place of the long sword |

A Swashbuckler can't later become a fighter, gladiator or ranger; a Shinobi
not a preserver, nor go with the Arena Champion, Sentinel or Brute kits. The
Shinobi's spells and slots are in [kits](#kits).

**Starting gear.** Bone long sword, sling, leather chest armour, Thieves'
Tools.

**More than one class.**

- *Multiclass:* cleric/thief (elf, half-elf, halfling, mul); druid/thief
  (half-elf, halfling, mul); fighter/thief and psionicist/thief (dwarf, elf,
  half-elf, halfling, mul); preserver/thief (elf, half-elf); ranger/thief
  (elf, half-elf, halfling); cleric/fighter/thief (elf, half-elf, mul);
  druid/fighter/thief (half-elf, mul); fighter/psionicist/thief (dwarf, elf,
  half-elf, halfling, mul); psionicist/ranger/thief (elf, half-elf,
  halfling); cleric/preserver/thief, cleric/psionicist/thief,
  cleric/ranger/thief, fighter/preserver/thief, preserver/psionicist/thief,
  preserver/ranger/thief (elf, half-elf); druid/preserver/thief,
  druid/psionicist/thief (half-elf).
- *Dual class:* with DEX 15, a human thief can become a cleric, druid,
  fighter, gladiator, preserver, psionicist or ranger.

**Magic weapons.** Every one ([the fighter's list](#fighter)). A **Shinobi**
only Greenbright\*, Shadowseeker\*, Mindshard\*, Stillwater\*, Dag's Dagger,
Terror Blade, Galefang\*, the quarterstaffs, bows, slings, Windlash\* and
Chatkcha +1.

### Preserver

*d4 · INT · elf, half-elf, human · XP for 2nd level 2,500, for 10th 250,000*

**How it plays.** The strongest magic and the weakest body: no armour, few
weapons, a d4 hit die. Keep it back, act before the enemy reaches it (a
character hit in a round can't cast), and choose its spells well.

**What the mod changes.**

- **INT limits learning:** a chance to learn each scroll's spell, and a most
  spells of each level ([learning spells](#learning-preserver-spells)).
  *Without the mod:* every scroll learnt, no limit.
- It **chooses** its starting spells and one at each level up.
- AD&D's wizard [spell slots](#spell-slots) (4 2 1 at 5th level; *without the
  mod:* 3 2 1).
- **Cat's Grace** in Flaming Sphere's place.
- With another class it may wear that class's armour but **can't cast in
  it**. **Bracers of defense** and the mod's two **robes** give AC without
  being armour.
- Up to 10th level; hit dice rolled twice.

**Weapons and armour.** No armour or shield as a single class. Daggers,
quarterstaffs, slings and staff slings (and the odd magic weapon the game
allows them).

**Kits.**

*Arcanist.* Scholars of the Veiled Alliance who live for the Art, hoarding
spells while their bodies wither from years of study in hiding. In a fight they
can weave two spells while others weave one.

*Scholar.* Keepers of forbidden lore who have spent more time over hidden
libraries than learning to hold a weapon. Every new level of skill brings
another spell into their books.

*Battle Mage.* Preservers who learned in the arena or the legions that a spell
is no use if you are dead before you finish it. They fight in leather with a
chosen weapon and keep casting while others bleed, at the cost of a little of
their magic.

| Kit | Gives | Costs | Starts with |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Arcanist** | a spell slot more at each spell level it has; in a fight, casts two preserver spells each turn instead of one | a d3 hit die | the preserver's gear |
| **Scholar** | a spell more learnt at each level up | THAC0 1 worse | the preserver's gear |
| **Battle Mage** | a warrior's THAC0; casts though hit earlier in the round; a d6 hit die; leather armour, cast in; expertise in one kind of weapon (3/2 attacks a round with it, 2 from 7th level) | one fewer spell slot at each spell level; nothing in the off hand | with weapon specialization, a plain weapon of its chosen kind in place of the quarterstaff |

A Battle Mage can't later become a fighter, gladiator or ranger. The
Battle Mage chooses its weapon on the weapon pages after taking the kit.

**Starting gear.** Quarterstaff, sling; two 1st-level spells of its choice.

**More than one class.**

- *Multiclass:* with cleric, fighter, psionicist, ranger or thief (elf,
  half-elf), with druid (half-elf); in threes cleric/fighter/preserver,
  cleric/preserver/psionicist, cleric/preserver/ranger,
  cleric/preserver/thief, fighter/preserver/psionicist,
  fighter/preserver/thief, preserver/psionicist/ranger,
  preserver/psionicist/thief, preserver/ranger/thief (elf, half-elf), and
  druid/fighter/preserver, druid/preserver/psionicist, druid/preserver/thief
  (half-elf).
- *Dual class:* with INT 15, a human preserver can become a cleric, druid,
  fighter, gladiator, psionicist, ranger or thief. A human who becomes a
  preserver chooses its first two spells.

**Magic weapons.** Hornblade +1 (a bone long sword the game lets preservers
use), Dag's Dagger +3, Terror Blade +2, Galefang\* +2, Quarterstaff +2, Balk's
Staff +1, Parting Staff +1, Sling +2, Sling +1, Windlash\* +1. A **Battle
Mage** also those of its chosen kind.

### Cleric

*d8 · WIS · any race · XP for 2nd level 1,500, for 10th 450,000*

**How it plays.** A priest of one element (air, earth, fire or water) in any
armour, knowing every spell of its spheres from the start, with bonus slots
for WIS. Its element decides its weapons, so choose with them in mind: earth
has the most, air and fire the fewest.

**What the mod changes.**

- AD&D's priest [spell slots](#spell-slots) (3 3 1 at 5th level; *without the
  mod:* 3 2 1) and THAC0 (20 to 3rd level, 18 at 4th; *without the mod:* 19 at
  3rd).
- With another class, its sphere still limits weapons. *Without the mod:* the
  other class's list was enough.
- Up to 10th level; hit dice rolled twice.

**Weapons and armour.** Any armour and shield. Weapons by sphere:

| Sphere | May wield | Plain weapons |
|---|---|---|
| Air | missile and thrown weapons, daggers | chatkcha, bow, sling, staff sling |
| Earth | stone, obsidian, metal, wood | obsidian and metal long swords, daggers and short swords; metal and obsidian maces, axes and great axes; club; stone and metal picks; quarterstaff; metal polearm; chatkcha; bow |
| Fire | obsidian | obsidian long sword, dagger, short sword, mace, axe and great axe; chatkcha |
| Water | bone, wood | bone long sword, dagger, short sword, mace, axe, great axe and polearm; club; quarterstaff; gythka; cahulaks; bow |

**Kits.**

*Healer.* Elemental priests who answer to the needs of the dying more than to
the temples, using water and earth to close wounds. They keep a free hand for
the work and won't fill it with a weapon.

*Crusader.* Warrior priests who carry their element's anger into battle, as
deadly with a weapon as any soldier. Their prayers are fewer for it.

*Elementalist.* Priests who have bargained with two of the elemental lords at
once and wield both powers. Divided worship comes slowly, and their spells lag
a level behind.

| Kit | Gives | Costs | Starts with |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Healer** | Cure Light, Serious and Critical Wounds heal 1 more a die | no weapon in the off hand | the cleric's gear |
| **Crusader** | a warrior's THAC0; a warrior's extra attacks in melee (3/2 a round from 7th level) | one fewer spell slot at each spell level | the cleric's gear |
| **Elementalist** | a second sphere: its spells and its weapons | spell slots a level behind | the cleric's gear |

A Crusader can't later become a fighter, gladiator or ranger; a Healer doesn't
go with the Twin-blade kit. The Elementalist chooses its second sphere on the
CLERICAL SPHERE list.

**Starting gear.** Shield, leather chest and arm armour, a club in the
backpack.

**More than one class.**

- *Multiclass:* cleric/fighter and cleric/psionicist (all but humans);
  cleric/ranger (elf, half-elf, half-giant, halfling, thri-kreen);
  cleric/thief (elf, half-elf, halfling, mul); cleric/preserver (elf,
  half-elf); cleric/fighter/psionicist (dwarf, elf, half-elf, thri-kreen);
  cleric/fighter/thief (elf, half-elf, mul); cleric/psionicist/ranger (elf,
  half-elf, thri-kreen); cleric/fighter/preserver,
  cleric/preserver/psionicist, cleric/preserver/ranger,
  cleric/preserver/thief, cleric/psionicist/thief, cleric/ranger/thief (elf,
  half-elf).
- *Dual class:* with WIS 15, a human cleric can become a fighter, gladiator,
  preserver, psionicist, ranger (if good) or thief; never a druid.

**Magic weapons**, by sphere:

- **Air:** Galefang\* +2, Bow +2, Phrain's Bow +1, Sling +2, Sling +1,
  Windlash\* +1, Chatkcha +1.
- **Earth:** Dragonsbane +4, El's Drinker +2, Dark Flame +2, Bloodwrath +1,
  Flame Blade\* +1, Greenbright\* +2, Shadowseeker\* +1, Mindshard\* +1, Dag's
  Dagger +3, Terror Blade +2, Galefang\* +2, Glasshewer\* +2, Soulcrusher +1,
  Axe +1, Headsman\* +2, Linebreaker\* +2, Blackmace +1, the three
  quarterstaffs, Gutterknot\* +1, Deepbiter\* +1, Bow +2, Phrain's Bow +1,
  Chatkcha +1.
- **Fire:** Dark Flame +2, Bloodwrath +1, Flame Blade\* +1, Mindshard\* +1,
  Glasshewer\* +2, Blackmace +1, Chatkcha +1.
- **Water:** Stillwater\* +1,
  Drakejaw\* +1, Gythka +3, Gythka +2\*,
  Kreenfang\* +1, Polearm +1, Thornwall\* +1, Mace +2, the three quarterstaffs,
  Gutterknot\* +1, Cahulaks +1, Bow +2, Phrain's Bow +1.

An Elementalist adds its second sphere's.

### Druid

*d8 · WIS · half-elf, halfling, human, mul, thri-kreen · true neutral · XP
for 2nd level 2,000, for 10th 125,000*

**How it plays.** A priest of the land and its element: no armour, but any
weapon, the cheapest levels in the game, and the only priest with the common
4th and 5th-level spells (the great cures among them). +2 on saves against fire
and electricity.

**What the mod changes.**

- AD&D's priest [spell slots](#spell-slots) and THAC0, as the cleric's.
- Up to 10th level; hit dice rolled twice.

**Weapons and armour.** No armour or shield, but the mod's two robes. Every
weapon but the great axes (the game's lists).

**Kits.**

*Grove Warden.* Guardians of an oasis or a hidden grove, whose skin toughens
like bark the longer they keep watch. They refuse metal, which the land gave up
only at great cost.

*Wanderer.* Druids with no grove of their own, crossing salt flats and stony
barrens under the sun and the freezing night. Heat and cold barely touch them,
but they rarely stop long enough to armour themselves properly.

*Lifebinder.* Druids devoted to the life in what defilers have left behind,
mending wounds as they would mend a dying field. They fight only with blunt
weapons, which wound without spilling blood.

| Kit | Gives | Costs | Starts with |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Grove Warden** | AC 1 better for every 3 druid levels | no metal weapons | the druid's gear |
| **Wanderer** | +3 on saves against fire and cold | AC 1 worse | the druid's gear |
| **Lifebinder** | Cure Wounds spells heal a d8 more, Blood Flow a d6 | blunt weapons only (club, mace, quarterstaff, sling, staff sling) | the druid's gear |

A Lifebinder doesn't go with the Brute kit.

**Starting gear.** Club, sling.

**More than one class.**

- *Multiclass:* druid/fighter and druid/psionicist (half-elf, halfling, mul,
  thri-kreen); druid/thief (half-elf, halfling, mul); druid/preserver
  (half-elf); druid/fighter/psionicist (half-elf, thri-kreen);
  druid/fighter/thief (half-elf, mul); druid/fighter/preserver,
  druid/preserver/psionicist, druid/preserver/thief, druid/psionicist/thief
  (half-elf).
- *Dual class:* with WIS 15, a human druid can become a fighter, gladiator,
  preserver, psionicist or thief; never a cleric, nor a ranger (who must be
  good). A human of another class becomes a druid only if true neutral.

**Magic weapons.** Every one but Great Axe +3 and Headsman\*. A **Grove
Warden** none of the metal ones (Dragonsbane, El's Drinker, Greenbright\*,
Shadowseeker\*, Dag's Dagger, Galefang\*, Soulcrusher, Axe +1, Linebreaker\*);
a **Lifebinder** only Mace +2, Blackmace +1, the three quarterstaffs,
Gutterknot\* +1, the slings and Windlash\*.

### Psionicist

*d6 · WIS · any race · XP for 2nd level 2,200, for 10th 400,000*

**How it plays.** The master of the mind's three disciplines, with a new power
at each level (two at odd levels and at 4th) paid for in PSP. Light armour and
small weapons; +2 on saves against mind-affecting spells and charms. Every
other character has one discipline and uses it as a 1st-level psionicist.

**What the mod changes.**

- Its limits on armour and weapons hold whatever its other classes.
  *Without the mod:* another class's lists were enough.
- Up to 10th level; hit dice rolled twice.

**Weapons and armour.** Light armour, a leather shield, or one of the mod's
robes. Daggers, bone and
obsidian short swords, clubs, chatkchas and bows (the game's lists leave out
its maces, slings and the metal short sword).

**Kits.**

*Mind Warrior.* Students of the Way who turned their discipline to the body,
fighting like trained soldiers with minds as sharp as their blades. Their
training leaves a little less room for the powers of the mind.

*Mind Bender.* Masters of other minds, at ease reaching into thoughts and
bending wills. Moving the world with thought alone comes harder to them.

*Kineticist.* Psionicists who move the world with their minds, throwing stone
and flame with a thought. Reaching into another mind costs them more.

| Kit | Gives | Costs | Starts with |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Mind Warrior** | a warrior's THAC0; a warrior's extra attacks in melee (3/2 a round from 7th level); a d8 hit die | a tenth fewer PSP | the psionicist's gear |
| **Mind Bender** | telepathy powers cost 2 PSP less | psychokinesis powers cost 2 PSP more | the psionicist's gear |
| **Kineticist** | psychokinesis powers cost 2 PSP less | telepathy powers cost 2 PSP more | the psionicist's gear |

A Mind Warrior can't later become a fighter, gladiator or ranger. The powers
and their costs are in [Psionics](#psionics).

**Starting gear.** Club, bow and arrows, leather chest armour.

**More than one class.**

- *Multiclass:* cleric/psionicist and fighter/psionicist (all but humans);
  druid/psionicist (half-elf, halfling, mul, thri-kreen); psionicist/ranger
  (elf, half-elf, half-giant, halfling, thri-kreen); psionicist/thief (dwarf,
  elf, half-elf, halfling, mul); preserver/psionicist (elf, half-elf);
  cleric/fighter/psionicist (dwarf, elf, half-elf, thri-kreen);
  fighter/psionicist/thief (dwarf, elf, half-elf, halfling, mul);
  cleric/psionicist/ranger (elf, half-elf, thri-kreen);
  psionicist/ranger/thief (elf, half-elf, halfling); druid/fighter/psionicist
  (half-elf, thri-kreen); cleric/preserver/psionicist,
  cleric/psionicist/thief, fighter/preserver/psionicist,
  preserver/psionicist/ranger, preserver/psionicist/thief (elf, half-elf);
  druid/preserver/psionicist, druid/psionicist/thief (half-elf).
- *Dual class:* with WIS 15, a human psionicist can become a cleric, druid,
  fighter, gladiator, preserver, ranger or thief.

**Magic weapons.** Mindshard\* +1, Stillwater\* +1, Dag's Dagger +3, Terror
Blade +2, Galefang\* +2, Gutterknot\* +1, Bow +2, Phrain's Bow +1, Chatkcha +1.
With a cleric class, only those its sphere allows too (Mindshard with fire or
earth, Stillwater with water).

## Kits

A character of one class takes one of three kits for its class when it is
made, or none, on the creation panel's **KIT** page; a human who changes class
can take one for its new class. Each gives something and costs something; the
class sections above have each kit's details and starting gear.

- The **Myrmidon** and **Battle Mage** choose their extra weapon spec on the
  weapon pages after taking the kit, and the **Elementalist** its second sphere
  on the CLERICAL SPHERE list.
- A kit belongs to its class: a human who changes class keeps it, asleep until
  the new class's level passes the old.
- Some kits rule out classes a human could change to, and some can't go
  together in a human who changes class (one kit for each class); the DUAL
  window and the kit menu leave them out:

  | Kit | Can't become |
  |---|---|
  | Seeker, Justifier | cleric, druid |
  | Shinobi | preserver |
  | Swashbuckler, Crusader, Battle Mage, Mind Warrior | fighter, gladiator, ranger |
  | Arena Champion, Sentinel | druid, preserver |
  | Brute | psionicist, air cleric |

  | Kit | Can't go with |
  |---|---|
  | Arena Champion, Sentinel | Shinobi |
  | Twin-blade | Healer |
  | Brute | Shinobi, Lifebinder |

- The dice log names each change a kit makes to a new character's gear.

### Kits' spell slots

The kits that change spell slots, by the level of the kit's class (spells of
1st to 5th level), with [AD&D's class tables](#spell-slots) on:

| Level | Preserver | Arcanist | Battle Mage | Cleric | Crusader | Elementalist | Seeker (ranger) | Justifier (ranger) | Shinobi (thief) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1 | 2 | — | 1 | — | — | | | |
| 2 | 2 | 3 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 1 | | | |
| 3 | 2 1 | 3 2 | 1 | 2 1 | 1 | 2 | | | |
| 4 | 3 2 | 4 3 | 2 1 | 3 2 | 2 1 | 2 1 | | | |
| 5 | 4 2 1 | 5 3 2 | 3 1 | 3 3 1 | 2 2 | 3 2 | | | |
| 6 | 4 2 2 | 5 3 3 | 3 1 1 | 3 3 2 | 2 2 1 | 3 3 1 | 1 | | 1 |
| 7 | 4 3 2 1 | 5 4 3 2 | 3 2 1 | 3 3 2 1 | 2 2 1 | 3 3 2 | 2 | | 2 |
| 8 | 4 3 3 2 | 5 4 4 3 | 3 2 2 1 | 3 3 3 2 | 2 2 2 1 | 3 3 2 1 | 2 1 | | 2 1 |
| 9 | 4 3 3 2 1 | 5 4 4 3 2 | 3 2 2 1 | 4 4 3 2 1 | 3 3 2 1 | 3 3 3 2 | 2 2 | | 2 2 |
| 10 | 4 4 3 2 2 | 5 5 4 3 3 | 3 3 2 1 1 | 4 4 3 3 2 | 3 3 2 2 1 | 4 4 3 2 1 | 2 2 1 | 1 | 2 2 1 |

- A **Crusader** and an **Elementalist** add WIS's bonus slots as a cleric
  does; the Crusader still has one fewer at each spell level with them.
- A **Seeker** casts priest spells of its sphere at its ranger level less 5
  (1st-level spells from 6th, 2nd from 8th, 3rd at 10th); a **Justifier** at
  its level less 9. Neither gets bonus slots for WIS, and both have these in
  place of a ranger's own slots.
- A **Shinobi** casts preserver spells at its thief level less 5, from its own
  list, learning one at each level up from 6th: **1st level** Gaze Reflection,
  Charm Person, Shield, Color Spray, Wall of Fog; **2nd** Invisibility, Mirror
  Image, Blur, Detect Invisibility, Fog Cloud; **3rd** Blink, Haste, Protection
  from Normal Missiles, Hold Person.
- An **Arcanist** casts two preserver spells each turn in a fight instead of
  one: its first spell doesn't end its turn, so it can cast again (being hit
  before the second still stops it); a **Scholar** chooses two spells at each level
  up.

## Weapon specialization and attacks

Warriors train in kinds of weapon. Choose them on the creation panel's
**WEAPON SPEC** pages; picks due later come in a window at the level up.

| Who | Chooses | With a chosen kind |
|---|---|---|
| Fighter | 1 kind | specialized: +1 to hit, +2 damage; **mastery** from 5th level: +3 to hit, +3 damage; **grand mastery** from 9th: the same, the damage die a size larger and one more attack a round |
| Gladiator | 2 kinds, a 3rd at 6th level, a 4th at 9th | specialized in each: +1 to hit, +2 damage |
| Ranger | the bow, and 1 kind | expertise: a specialist's attacks, no other bonus |

The sixteen kinds: long sword, club, dagger, short sword, mace, axe, great
axe, pick, quarterstaff, polearm, gythka, cahulaks, chatkcha, bow, sling and
staff sling. A warrior with another class chooses only kinds that class lets
it use.

**Attacks a round**, by the warrior's level (its best fighter, gladiator or
ranger level). 3/2 means one attack one round and two the next.

| With the weapon | Melee, 1-6 | Melee, 7-10 | Bow, 1-6 | Bow, 7-10 | Sling, staff sling, chatkcha, 1-6 | 7-10 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| anyone who isn't a warrior | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 1 |
| a warrior, a kind it hasn't chosen | 1 | 3/2 | 2 | 3 | 1 | 3/2 |
| a chosen kind (specialized, mastery, expertise) | 3/2 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 3/2 | 2 |
| grand mastery (9th level on) | | 3 | | 5 | | 3 |
| a **Crusader** or **Mind Warrior** (by its cleric or psionicist level), any weapon | 1 | 3/2 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 1 |
| a **Battle Mage** (by its preserver level), its chosen kind | 3/2 | 2 | | | | |
| a **Battle Mage**, any other weapon | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 1 |

The levels are the warrior's (its best fighter, gladiator or ranger level), or
for the three kits their own class's. A Battle Mage's chosen kind is a melee
weapon. With [two weapons](#two-weapons), the off hand attacks once a round
whatever the rate.

*Without the mod:* every warrior has 3/2 attacks a round in melee (2 from 7th
level) with any weapon, and no other bonus; missile weapons shoot at the
weapon's own rate for everyone.

## Fighting

### Initiative

At the start of each round everyone's initiative is **20 + a 0-9 roll + DEX's
adjustment**, +2 Hasted, −2 Slowed, −2 Blind; highest acts first. The weapon
makes no difference. **Wait** drops a character to act later.

| DEX | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6-15 | 16 | 17-18 | 19-20 | 21-23 | 24-25 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Adjustment | −6 | −4 | −3 | −2 | −1 | 0 | +1 | +2 | +3 | +4 | +5 |

A character hit in a round can't cast a spell until the next round (the Battle
Mage can).

### Hitting

An attack hits on **d20 ≥ THAC0 − the target's AC**. A 20 always hits and a 1
always misses, but **there are no critical hits**: a 20 does ordinary damage.
To-hit changes with:

- STR in melee, DEX with missiles;
- the weapon's plus; a plain weapon of wood is −3, of stone or obsidian −2, of
  bone −1 (metal has no penalty);
- weapon specialization;
- Bless and Prayer +1, Curse −1, Slow −4;
- attacking from behind +2, a backstab +2 more;
- two weapons ([below](#two-weapons)).

Damage is the weapon's dice, its plus, specialization's bonus and, in melee,
STR's bonus; at least 1.

### Two weapons

With a melee weapon in each hand:

- **−2 to hit with the main (right) hand and −4 with the off (left) hand,** and
  the DEX adjustment from [initiative](#initiative) added, which can lessen the
  penalty to 0 but never make it a bonus: DEX 17 is 0 and −2, DEX 21 is 0 and 0,
  DEX 3 is −5 and −7.
- **Rangers and Twin-blades** have no penalty.
- **The off hand attacks once a round.** Extra attacks are the main hand's: a
  warrior at 3/2 attacks 3/2 + 1 (one round 1 + 1, the next 2 + 1).

A weapon and a shield, or a weapon and a bow or sling, aren't two weapons.

*Without the mod:* no penalty (a small bonus at DEX 5 or less), and each hand
attacks at the character's full rate.

### From behind, and backstabs

- Each round a creature turns to face the first one to attack it, and keeps
  facing that way. An attacker in the square directly behind it attacks
  **from behind**: +2 to hit, and the target loses its DEX bonus and its
  shield.
- A **backstab** is a thief's attack from behind, in melee, with a weapon no
  heavier than a long sword (see [Equipment](#equipment)): +4 to hit in all,
  and the thief's first attack of the round does **×2** damage at levels 1-4,
  **×3** at 5-8 and **×4** at 9-10, STR's bonus included.

### Hiding in shadows

A thief or ranger whose turn comes in a fight **with no enemy in the eight
squares around** first tries to **hide in shadows**, then to **move
silently**. With both, their next attack that turn is from behind: a thief's is
a backstab with a light enough weapon. Attacking, or ending the turn, gives
them away. An enemy beside them when the turn comes means no hiding: get clear
first.

- Thieves' hiding is **halved in daylight** (under the open sky); rangers'
  is halved indoors instead.
- A worn cloak adds 10 to hiding in shadows and worn boots 10 to moving
  silently, up to 95. A worn belt adds 5 to a thief's picking pockets and
  opening locks.

*Without the mod:* thieves backstab only a target that has turned to face
someone else, and no one hides in a fight.

### Saving throws

A save succeeds when **d20 + its modifiers reaches the save's number**; a 1
always fails and a 20 always saves. Everyone has five: paralysis, poison and
death (`PPD`), rod, staff and wand (`RSW`), petrification and polymorph
(`PP`), breath weapon (`BW`) and spell (`SP`).

- **Spells are saved against with the spell save**, except poisons, death
  spells and psionic attacks (paralysis, poison and death).
- **Against fire, cold and electricity spells, DEX helps you dodge:**

  | DEX | 1-2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7-14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18-20 | 21-23 | 24-25 |
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
  | Modifier | −5 | −4 | −3 | −2 | −1 | 0 | +1 | +2 | +3 | +4 | +5 | +6 |

*Without the mod:* almost every spell is saved against with petrification and
polymorph, and against fire, cold and electricity the d20 counts double, so
most saves against a Fireball succeed.

Other modifiers:

| Modifier | On |
|---|---|
| WIS: −6 at 1, −4 at 2, −3 at 3, −2 at 4, −1 at 5-7, +1 at 15, +2 at 16, +3 at 17, +4 at 18 or more | mind-affecting spells, charms, holds, fear and illusions |
| CON: −2 at 1, −1 at 2, +1 at 19-20, +2 at 21-22, +3 at 23-24, +4 at 25; dwarves and halflings +1 more for every 3.5 points of CON | paralysis, poison and death |
| Druids +2 | fire and electricity |
| Psionicists +2 | mind-affecting spells and charms |
| Bless +1, Barkskin +1, Spirit Armor +3 (not PPD), Prayer ±1, a ring or cloak of protection +1 | every save |
| Protection from Evil +2; from Fire, from Cold +3; from Lightning +4 | against the matching caster or spell |
| +4 | against a spell at you alone, when its caster can't see you |

Creatures of 6th level or less can't save against Cloudkill; only warriors
save against Chaos; against Scare, 6th level and up always save and others
can't.

### Monsters

Monsters have defences of their own: some need magic weapons, some are hurt
only by edged weapons or immune to crushing ones, some shrug off fire, cold,
poison or the powers of the mind, some can't be charmed or held. **Look** at
one in a fight: the box shows its hit points, AC, THAC0, alignment, magic
resistance and chief defence (`NEEDS +1 WEAPON`, `IMM FIRE COLD`, `NO
CRUSH`, `HALF FROM WPNS`, `UNDEAD`), and closing it tells the rest. Undead
take nothing from poison or draining, and mind-affecting spells don't work on
them.

## Thieves' skills and picking pockets

A thief's skills come from the table by thief level, plus the race's and
DEX's adjustments. A thief who isn't Okay, or is Blind, Afraid, Confused,
Berserk or Paralyzed, can't use them; nothing worn stands in the way.

| Thief level | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pick pockets | 30 | 35 | 40 | 45 | 50 | 55 | 60 | 65 | 70 | 80 |
| Open locks | 25 | 29 | 33 | 37 | 42 | 47 | 52 | 57 | 62 | 67 |
| Find/remove traps | 20 | 25 | 30 | 35 | 40 | 45 | 50 | 55 | 60 | 65 |
| Move silently | 15 | 21 | 27 | 33 | 40 | 47 | 55 | 62 | 70 | 78 |
| Hide in shadows | 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 | 31 | 37 | 43 | 49 | 56 | 63 |
| Hear noise | 10 | 10 | 15 | 15 | 20 | 20 | 25 | 25 | 30 | 30 |
| Climb walls | 85 | 86 | 87 | 88 | 90 | 92 | 94 | 96 | 98 | 99 |
| Read languages | 0 | 0 | 0 | 20 | 25 | 30 | 35 | 40 | 45 | 50 |

| Race | Pick pockets | Open locks | Find/remove traps | Move silently | Hide in shadows | Hear noise | Climb walls | Read languages |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Dwarf | 0 | +10 | +15 | 0 | 0 | 0 | −10 | −5 |
| Elf | +5 | −5 | 0 | +5 | +10 | +5 | 0 | 0 |
| Half-elf | +10 | 0 | 0 | 0 | +5 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Halfling | +5 | +5 | +5 | +10 | +15 | +5 | −15 | −5 |
| Mul | 0 | −5 | 0 | +5 | 0 | 0 | +5 | −5 |

(Humans, half-giants and thri-kreen have none.)

| DEX | Pick pockets | Open locks | Find/remove traps | Move silently | Hide in shadows |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 9 | −15 | −10 | −10 | −20 | −10 |
| 10 | −10 | −5 | −10 | −15 | −5 |
| 11 | −5 | 0 | −5 | −10 | 0 |
| 12 | 0 | 0 | 0 | −5 | 0 |
| 13-15 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 16 | 0 | +5 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 17 | +5 | +10 | 0 | +5 | +5 |
| 18 | +10 | +15 | +5 | +10 | +10 |
| 19 | +15 | +20 | +10 | +15 | +15 |
| 20 | +20 | +25 | +12 | +20 | +17 |
| 21 | +25 | +27 | +15 | +25 | +20 |
| 22 | +27 | +30 | +17 | +30 | +22 |

Rangers hide and move silently with the thief's numbers for their ranger level
and the same race and DEX adjustments.

**When the skills are rolled:**

- **Open locks, find/remove traps, climb walls, hear noise** and the one
  pocket the game has to pick: when the game asks, at certain locks, traps
  and walls.
- **Hide in shadows and move silently:** at the start of a thief's or ranger's
  turn in a fight ([hiding in shadows](#hiding-in-shadows)).
- **Picking pockets** (the mod's): pick a thief's **Thieves' Tools** up on the
  inventory screen, go back to the map with them on the pointer, and click
  someone in sight (not in a fight). The thief rolls **pick pockets**:
  - **success:** one small thing from them goes into the thief's backpack:
    something light that isn't worn on the body;
  - **failure:** the thief rolls **move silently** to slip away. Made, they can
    try again; missed, they are caught, and that person keeps a hand on their
    pockets from then on.

  When nothing worth taking is left, the thief takes a few coins from the
  purse, and that is the last try on them. Every thief starts with a set of
  tools.
- **Read languages** is never rolled.

*Without the mod:* the game's own chances, which run much higher (a base of its
own plus 4 a level), and a penalty when a thief holds anything in either hand,
or has anything in the quiver or on the legs.

## Magic

### Spell slots

Casting uses a slot of the spell's level; resting fills them.

AD&D's tables:

| Level | Cleric, druid | Preserver |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 2 | 2 |
| 3 | 2 1 | 2 1 |
| 4 | 3 2 | 3 2 |
| 5 | 3 3 1 | 4 2 1 |
| 6 | 3 3 2 | 4 2 2 |
| 7 | 3 3 2 1 | 4 3 2 1 |
| 8 | 3 3 3 2 | 4 3 3 2 |
| 9 | 4 4 3 2 1 | 4 3 3 2 1 |
| 10 | 4 4 3 3 2 | 4 4 3 2 2 |

(The slots at 1st, 2nd, 3rd... spell level.) *Without the mod:* one table for
all three: 1; 2; 2 1; 2 2; 3 2 1; 3 2 2; 4 3 2 1; 4 3 2 2; 5 4 3 2 1;
5 4 3 2 2.

**Rangers** have one 1st-level slot at 8th level, two at 9th, and a 2nd-level
slot at 10th, as in AD&D. No spell is above 5th level.

**Clerics and druids** have more for WIS, only at spell levels their class
level reaches:

| WIS | 1st | 2nd | 3rd | 4th | 5th |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 13 | 1 | | | | |
| 14 | 2 | | | | |
| 15 | 2 | 1 | | | |
| 16 | 2 | 2 | | | |
| 17 | 3 | 2 | 1 | | |
| 18 | 3 | 2 | 2 | | |
| 19 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 1 | |
| 20 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 2 | |
| 21 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 1 |
| 22 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 2 |
| 23-24 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 |
| 25 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 |

A character's classes add up their slots. Several [kits](#kits) have more or
fewer. The game's USE screen shows what is left of each level.

### Learning preserver spells

A preserver chooses a spell at each level up, and can learn more from scrolls
(right-click the scroll in the inventory, then click its icon), of a level it
can cast. INT sets two limits:

| INT | Chance to learn from a scroll | Most spells of each level |
|---|---|---|
| 9 | 35% | 6 |
| 10 | 40% | 7 |
| 11 | 45% | 7 |
| 12 | 50% | 7 |
| 13 | 55% | 9 |
| 14 | 60% | 9 |
| 15 | 65% | 11 |
| 16 | 70% | 11 |
| 17 | 75% | 14 |
| 18 | 85% | 18 |
| 19 | 95% | all |
| 20-23 | 96-99% | all |
| 24-25 | 100% | all |

- **A failed roll uses the scroll up.**
- **A full spell level** learns no more: the scroll is kept.
- The level-up choice leaves out levels already full.

*Without the mod:* every scroll is learnt, and there is no limit.

### How spells work

- **Damage** grows with the caster's level up to **10th**: Fireball and
  Lightning Bolt do at most 10d6. Someone Out Cold gets no save and takes the
  most the dice can do.
- **Duration** is so much a caster level plus dice; a round is a minute of game
  time.
- **Caster level** is the caster's best level in a class whose sphere has the
  spell. A ranger casts at its level less 7, for what it may cast and for
  damage and duration alike. An elemental spell works only for a priest of
  that element.
- **Area spells catch the caster** and the party.
- Shillelagh, Flame Blade and Spiritual Hammer need an empty hand.
- Cause Serious and Critical Wounds roll 2d9 and 3d9; Cure Light, Serious and
  Critical Wounds heal 1d8, 2d8+1 and 3d8+3.
- **Cat's Grace** is a 2nd-level wizard spell in Flaming Sphere's place: DEX +
  1d6 (at most 24) for an hour of game time a caster level, which betters AC,
  initiative, thief skills and dodging.

| 5 | Conjure Air Elemental, Deflection, Insect Plague | Conjure Earth Elemental, Ironskin, Quicksand | Conjure Fire Elemental, Flame Strike, Wall of Fire | Conjure Water Elemental, Quicksand |

An Elementalist has its second sphere's column too.

### Effects

| Effect | Does |
|---|---|
| Blessed / Cursed | +1 / −1 to hit (Bless also +1 on saves); they cancel each other |
| Hasted / Slowed | Hasted: double movement and attacks, +2 initiative. Slowed: half, loses every other turn, −4 to hit, AC 4 worse, −2 initiative |
| Paralyzed | no turns; fails every save |
| Stuck (Grease, Web, Entangle and the like) | can't move; Free Action stops it |
| Afraid | runs; can't attack or cast |
| Charmed | fights for the caster |
| Confused | each turn: runs off, does nothing, fights for a side picked at random, or acts normally |
| Berserk | fights for a side picked at random; can't cast |
| Can't attack | can't attack or cast harmful spells |
| Blind | AC 4 worse, −2 initiative; can't cast spells that need sight |
| Acid | 2d4 a round |
| Poisoned | fatal if time passes out of a fight (resting, for one) before it wears off or is cured |
| Stoneskin, Mirror Image | each blow stopped, or image struck, uses a charge |
| Invisible | ends with an attack or a harmful spell (Improved Invisibility doesn't) |

## Psionics

A power costs PSP to use, and one kept up costs more at the start of each
round; when the PSP run short, it drops. Against a psionic attack, a character
raises the best defence mode it knows and can pay for, by itself.

| Power | Discipline | PSP to use | Each round kept up |
|---|---|---|---|
| Detonate | psychokinesis | 18 | |
| Disintegrate | psychokinesis | 40 | |
| Project Force | psychokinesis | 10 | |
| Ballistic Attack | psychokinesis | 5 | |
| Control Body | psychokinesis | 8 | |
| Inertial Barrier | psychokinesis | 7 | 5 |
| Animal Affinity | psychometabolism | 15 | 4 |
| Energy Containment | psychometabolism | 10 | |
| Life Draining | psychometabolism | 11 | |
| Absorb Disease | psychometabolism | 12 | |
| Adrenalin Control | psychometabolism | 8 | 4 |
| Biofeedback | psychometabolism | 6 | 3 |
| Body Weaponry | psychometabolism | 9 | 4 |
| Cell Adjustment | psychometabolism | 5 | |
| Displacement | psychometabolism | 6 | 3 |
| Enhanced Strength | psychometabolism | 0 | 8 |
| Flesh Armor | psychometabolism | 8 | 4 |
| Graft Weapon | psychometabolism | 10 | 1 |
| Lend Health | psychometabolism | 4 | |
| Share Strength | psychometabolism | 6 | 2 |
| Domination | telepathy | 0 | |
| Mass Domination | telepathy | 0 | |
| Psychic Crush (attack) | telepathy | 7 | |
| Superior Invisibility | telepathy | 5 | 5 |
| Tower of Iron Will (defence) | telepathy | 6 | |
| Ego Whip (attack) | telepathy | 4 | |
| Id Insinuation (attack) | telepathy | 5 | |
| Intellect Fortress (defence) | telepathy | 4 | |
| Mental Barrier (defence) | telepathy | 3 | |
| Mind Bar | telepathy | 6 | 4 |
| Mind Blank (defence) | telepathy | 0 | |
| Psionic Blast (attack) | telepathy | 10 | |
| Synaptic Static | telepathy | 15 | 10 |
| Thought Shield (defence) | telepathy | 1 | |

Mind Bar gives 75% magic resistance to mind-affecting spells. Body Weaponry
makes unarmed blows 2d4. The Mind Bender and Kineticist [kits](#kits) change
some costs.

## Equipment

**Weapons.** Most are wood, bone, stone or obsidian; plain ones of those hit
worse than metal ([hitting](#hitting)), and can break (1 chance in 160 after a
hit; not clubs or quarterstaffs). Weapons of every kind come in several
materials, the short sword among them.

| Weapon | Damage | Can backstab |
|---|---|---|
| Dagger | 1d4 | yes |
| Short sword | 1d6 | yes |
| Long sword | 1d8 | yes |
| Club | 1d6 | yes |
| Quarterstaff | 1d6 | yes |
| Axe | 1d8 | bone ones |
| Pick | 1d4+1 | yes |
| Great axe (two-handed) | 1d10 | no |
| Mace | 1d6+1 | no |
| Cahulaks | 1d6 | no |
| Gythka (two-handed) | 2d4 | no |
| Polearm | 1d10 | no |
| Bow, sling, staff sling, chatkcha | by the missile | no: missiles never backstab |

A half-giant holds a two-handed weapon in one hand, with a shield or a light
weapon in the other.

**Armour** lowers AC, and DEX lowers it more. **Helms give AC 1**, and
**boots give one more move** each round of a fight. *Without the mod:* helms
give no AC and boots no movement.

**Protection.** Rings and cloaks of protection give +1 AC and +1 on every save,
by AD&D's rules: two rings don't add up; a ring gives no AC with magical armour
(its saves still count); a cloak does nothing with magical or metal armour or
a shield. **Bracers of defense** give their AC (6, 5, 4 or 2), and the mod's
two **robes** their plus, only with no armour worn, and a preserver casts in
either. These are rare finds.

**Acid.** Some monsters' acid or corroding touch can destroy worn armour or a
held weapon. Each item gets a saving throw by its material: wood 8, bone 11,
stone and obsidian 5, metal 13, leather 10, cloth 12, less its plus (a weapon
uses the game's own number where that's easier). *Without the mod:* plain
armour is destroyed outright.

**Item boxes** (right-click an item in the inventory) show a wand's or other
charged item's charges left, and a cloak's, boots' or belt's bonus to thief
skills.

### New items

The mod adds items the game never had, or never placed: here is what each
is, not where it is (the README lists that, for those who want it). The mod's
magic weapons are also marked \* in each class's list.

**Mundane:**

| Item | What it is |
|---|---|
| Bone, obsidian and metal short swords | 1d6; the game has no short sword |
| Bone and obsidian axes | 1d8 |
| Bone, obsidian and metal great axes | 1d10, two-handed |
| Bone and metal daggers | 1d4; the bone one is the only dagger a water cleric can use |
| Obsidian and metal maces | 1d6+1 |
| Metal pick, metal polearm | the game's, in metal |
| Bone Scale Arm Armor, Leg Armor and Bone Helm | the rest of the bone scale set whose chest piece the game has |
| Helm | a leather helm |
| Thieves' Tools | [picking pockets](#thieves-skills-and-picking-pockets); every thief starts with a set |

New characters with weapon specialization start with a plain weapon of their
chosen kind, often one of these.

**Magic weapons:**

| Item | What it is | Who can wield it |
|---|---|---|
| Flame Blade | obsidian long sword +1 whose blade burns what it hits: 2d6 fire damage, a save for half | warriors, thieves, druids, earth and fire clerics |
| Greenbright | metal short sword +2 | warriors, thieves, druids, earth clerics |
| Shadowseeker | metal short sword +1: its wielder sees the invisible | warriors, thieves, druids, earth clerics |
| Mindshard | obsidian short sword +1 | warriors, thieves, druids, psionicists, earth and fire clerics |
| Stillwater | bone short sword +1 | warriors, thieves, druids, psionicists, water clerics |
| Galefang | metal dagger +2 | warriors, thieves, druids, preservers, psionicists, air and earth clerics |
| Glasshewer | obsidian axe +2 | warriors, thieves, druids, earth and fire clerics |
| Drakejaw | bone axe +1 | warriors, thieves, druids, water clerics |
| Headsman | metal great axe +2 | warriors, thieves, earth clerics |
| Gythka +2, Kreenfang (+1) | gythkas, two-handed | warriors, thieves, druids, water clerics |
| Linebreaker | metal polearm +2 | warriors, thieves, druids, earth clerics |
| Thornwall | bone polearm +1 | warriors, thieves, druids, water clerics |
| Gutterknot | club +1 (the game has no magic club) | warriors, thieves, druids, psionicists, earth and water clerics |
| Deepbiter | stone pick +1 | warriors, thieves, druids, earth clerics |
| Windlash | staff sling +1 | warriors, thieves, druids, preservers, air clerics |

**Other magic items:**

| Item | What it does |
|---|---|
| Ring of Protection +1 (two), Cloak of Protection +1 | +1 AC and +1 on every save ([protection](#equipment)) |
| Bracers of Defense (four pairs: AC 6, 5, 4 and 2) | their AC with no armour worn; a preserver casts in them |
| Ashen Robe | worn on the chest by preservers, psionicists and druids, not armour: AC 1 better with no armour, +1 on saves against spells |
| Veiled Robe, a robe of the Veiled Alliance | the same, AC 2 better, +1 on every save, and a wizard spell slot more at spell levels 1, 2 and 3 |
| Inixhide | leather chest armour +1 |
| Warden's Chest, Arms, Legs and Helm | plate armour +1 in four pieces: the chest 4 points of AC better, the arms and legs 3 each, the helm 2 (a helm's AC 1, +1): 12 better as a set, so AC 10 becomes −2 before DEX; the chest gives Resist Fire, the helm Cloak of Bravery, while worn |
| Arrowbane | a circlet: Protection from Normal Missiles while worn; not armour |
| Sunking Crown | a crown: Protection from Evil while worn; not armour |
| Cloak of Elvenkind, Boots of Elvenkind | help a thief or ranger [hide and move silently](#hiding-in-shadows); thieves and rangers only |
| Tome of Understanding | read from the inventory as a scroll: +1 WIS for good (at most 25) |
| Six scrolls | spells the game has no scroll of |

The game's own Grey's Scale arm and leg armour is AC 3 each with the mod (2
without).

## Experience and levels

Experience comes from kills (an equal share for each character, split again
between a character's classes) and from deeds along the way. A level up comes
by itself, with hit points, a better THAC0 and saves, spell slots, a new
preserver spell or psionic power, and any weapon spec due.

Every class goes up to **10th level**. *Without the mod:* 9th.

AD&D's tables:

| To reach level | Fighter | Gladiator, ranger | Cleric | Druid | Preserver | Psionicist | Thief |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2 | 2,000 | 2,250 | 1,500 | 2,000 | 2,500 | 2,200 | 1,250 |
| 3 | 4,000 | 4,500 | 3,000 | 4,000 | 5,000 | 4,400 | 2,500 |
| 4 | 8,000 | 9,000 | 6,000 | 7,500 | 10,000 | 8,800 | 5,000 |
| 5 | 16,000 | 18,000 | 13,000 | 12,500 | 20,000 | 16,500 | 10,000 |
| 6 | 32,000 | 36,000 | 27,500 | 20,000 | 40,000 | 30,000 | 20,000 |
| 7 | 64,000 | 75,000 | 55,000 | 35,000 | 60,000 | 55,000 | 40,000 |
| 8 | 125,000 | 150,000 | 110,000 | 60,000 | 90,000 | 100,000 | 70,000 |
| 9 | 250,000 | 300,000 | 225,000 | 90,000 | 135,000 | 200,000 | 110,000 |
| 10 | 500,000 | 600,000 | 450,000 | 125,000 | 250,000 | 400,000 | 160,000 |

*Without the mod:* a gladiator needs what a fighter does, a ranger 2,200 for
2nd level and a thief 1,200.

## Worth knowing

- **Cure poison before resting.** A character still Poisoned when time passes
  out of a fight dies.
- **Area spells catch the caster and the party.** Aim fireballs and clouds
  away from your own.
- **Act before you are hit if you mean to cast.** A character hit earlier in
  the round can't cast (a Battle Mage can).
- **Someone Out Cold takes the most a spell's dice can do,** with no save.
- **Two weapons cost to-hit** unless your DEX is high or you are a ranger or
  Twin-blade, and the off hand attacks only once a round.
- **A warrior's weapon specs matter:** outside them it attacks once a round
  until 7th level.
- **Multi-class preservers take off their armour to cast** (a helm counts).
- **Thieves hide with no enemy beside them** when their turn comes; step away
  first. Daylight halves their chance, and rangers' indoors.
- **Plain wood, bone, stone and obsidian weapons can break** (clubs and
  quarterstaffs can't); magic ones never do.
- **Spell damage stops growing at caster level 10.**
- **Wait** puts a character later in the round.
- **Ready a missile weapon and a melee weapon:** the game uses whichever fits
  the target's distance.
