# Changelog

What changed in Templar's Ledger, pull request by pull request, newest first.
Released pull requests are summarised in a line or two each; the release notes
([1.1.0](release-notes/v1.1.0.md): #14 to #18; [1.0.0](release-notes/v1.0.0.md):
#1 to #13) and the pull requests themselves have the detail.

## Pull request #31 (in progress)

**Changed**
- **The helper loads into upper memory again,** leaving the game 62 KB more
  conventional memory (632 KB free, was 570): the dice log's ring buffer now
  follows the helper in a segment of its own, so the helper's image is 40 KB
  (was 63) and what it asks for fits DOSBox's upper memory. It also leaves
  room in its segment for the kits' code.

**Added**
- **Kits:** a character of one class may take one of three kits
  for its class, or none, on the creation panel's new KIT page (KITS, at the
  end of the panel's pages: the disciplines' for a class with no sphere, the
  spheres' for a cleric, druid or ranger, the last weapon page for a warrior
  with weapon specialization), NO KIT first and what a new character has, the
  rows not chosen greyed as the spheres' are. The kit is kept with the
  character (sheet `+43h`), and the Effects screen (`KIT: RAVAGER`) and the
  Ledger's Characters tab name it. A new switch on the Options tab, under Rule
  changes.
- **Kits that work so far:** the Myrmidon, Sentinel and Ravager (fighter); the
  Arena Champion, Twin-blade and Brute (gladiator); the Stalker (ranger); the
  Assassin (thief); the Grove Warden and Wanderer (druid); the Lifebinder's
  weapons, and the Shinobi's weapons and armour. The guide's
  Kits has what each does. The dice log and the Ledger show each kit's part; a
  new probe in the game (INT B8h) makes the Sentinel's initiative.
- **Kits' THAC0:** the Swashbuckler, Crusader, Battle Mage and Mind Warrior
  get a warrior's THAC0, the Scholar's is 1 worse, through a new probe at the
  end of the game's THAC0 routine (INT B7h); the Swashbuckler's −10 to every
  thief skill, named in the dice log's thief skill lines as the Assassin's
  now is.
- **Kits' spell slots:** the Arcanist's wizard slots 1 more at each spell
  level, the Battle Mage's and Crusader's 1 fewer, the Elementalist's a level
  behind, the Seeker's and Justifier's priest slots their own tables, through
  two new probes in the game's slot routine (INT B6h, INT B5h); the Ledger's
  Spells tab counts them the same way.
- **Kits' PSP:** the Mind Bender's telepathy powers (the defence modes too)
  cost 2 PSP less to use and to keep up and its psychokinesis 2 more, the
  Kineticist's the other way about, through new probes where the game prices
  a power (INT B4h, B3h, B2h, B0h, AEh).
- **Kits' healing:** the Healer's Cure Light, Serious and Critical Wounds heal
  1 more a die, and the Lifebinder's cures heal a die more (INT B1h); the dice
  log shows each. The Healer may hold no weapon in the off hand.
- **The Battle Mage** casts though hit earlier in the round (the game stops
  anyone else: INT ADh), and holds nothing in the off hand.
- **Kits' casting level:** the Seeker casts at its ranger level less 5 and the
  Justifier less 9 (a ranger's: less 7), which also lets a Seeker of 6th level
  choose 1st-level priest spells for its slots (INT AFh). The level a
  spell's duration and damage take, which the game works out apart from
  that (with a ranger's whole level), now has the kits' too (INT A6h).
- **Rangers' casting level (a rule, on by default):** a ranger's spells last
  and do damage as cast at its level less 7, as the spell levels it may cast
  already count it; the game took the whole ranger level (a 9th-level
  ranger's spells lasted as a 9th-level priest's). A multiclass ranger casts
  at the better of its classes, the ranger's counted 7 less (INT A6h).
- **The Shinobi's spells:** preserver spells from 6th thief level on the
  Seeker's slots, cast at the thief level less 5, from its own list of 14:
  one learnt at each level up from 6th, on the game's CHOOSE A SPELL screen,
  which shows its spells only, up to the spell level it casts; none learnt
  from scrolls (INT ACh, A8h, A7h, ABh, AAh, A9h, and the level-up's probe).
  The Ledger's Spells tab shows its slots.
- **The Scholar** learns a spell more at each level up: CHOOSE A SPELL comes
  up twice.
- **The Battle Mage's weapon and armour:** it wears light armour (leather, or
  none) and casts in it; with weapon specialization it chooses one weapon spec
  (long sword, club, dagger, short sword, mace, axe or pick) on the weapon
  pages, which the panel now offers it, may use those weapons as well as a
  preserver's own, and attacks with them at expertise's rate, 3/2 a round (2
  from 7th level). The game's equip check, the fight, View Character's and the
  inventory's DAM lines, the Effects screen (EXPERT IN) and the Ledger all
  count it.
- **The Elementalist's second sphere:** chosen on the creation panel's
  CLERICAL SPHERE list once the kit is taken (a second row marked beside its
  own), its spells known from the start, as its own sphere's are, cast at its
  cleric level, and its weapons allowed as well as its own sphere's (INT A1h,
  A0h, 9Fh, 9Eh). The Characters tab names it. Every kit now works.
- **The Seeker's weapons** are its sphere's, as a cleric's of that sphere,
  but for the bow, on the weapon pages and when equipping. **The Justifier's**
  expertise with the bow and its chosen weapon spec is specialization (+1 to
  hit, +2 damage), with weapon specialization.
- **Kits' hit dice and PSP:** the Battle Mage rolls a d6 for its hit points,
  the Mind Warrior a d8 and has a tenth fewer PSP (rounded down), and the
  Arcanist a d3, at each level up and on the creation screen: choosing or
  taking back one of these kits rolls the new character's hit points and
  works out its PSP again (the game did both only when a class was clicked),
  and the screen shows the new numbers (INT A5h, A4h, A3h, A2h). The dice
  log's hit point lines name the kit's die.
- **A kit sleeps when a human dual-classes** (DUAL on a portrait's menu), as
  the class it was chosen with does, and wakes, gifts and costs, once the new
  class's level passes the old one's. The Effects screen adds DORMANT under
  the kit and the Characters tab names the level to pass. Awake, it goes by
  its own class's level; its hit die counts only for its own class. A Battle
  Mage's chosen weapon spec stays the kit's (expertise when awake, nothing
  while asleep), not a new fighter's specialization.
- **Classes a kit bars on dual-classing,** greyed on the DUAL window (INT
  9Dh): a Seeker or Justifier can't become a cleric or druid, a Shinobi a
  preserver (their own slot tables would replace the new class's); the
  Swashbuckler, Crusader, Battle Mage and Mind Warrior no warrior class (they
  have a warrior's THAC0 already); an Arena Champion or Sentinel no druid or
  preserver (no shield); a Brute no psionicist or air cleric (no two-handed
  melee weapon).
- **Weapon specs are weapons learnt for good,** while the class or kit that
  gave them is awake: no kit forbids a kind the character specialized in (but
  for the off hand's rules). A dual-classed human's chosen kinds sleep with
  their class, as before, and come back when it wakes.
- **A human who becomes a preserver picks its two spells** on the game's
  CHOOSE A SPELL window (1st level only), not Grease and Magic Missile (INT
  9Ch).
- **The Stalker hides in shadows indoors** with its full chance (the stealth
  rule halves a ranger's indoors).
- **Starting gear fitted to the kit:** the game's class gear, given at DONE,
  is changed while the character is new where the kit can't use it: a
  Shinobi's long sword becomes a bone short sword, a Brute's a bone great axe
  (its club to the backpack), a Seeker's of its sphere's material, a
  Ravager's shield goes to the backpack; an Arena Champion's off-hand club
  becomes a shield, and a Battle Mage's quarterstaff its weapon spec's weapon.
  The dice log names each change. The guide lists each class's starting gear.

**Changed** (for the kits)
- **The Arcanist's drawback** is a d3 hit die (a preserver's is a d4), in
  place of −2 CON.
- **The dice log's ring holds 96 entries** (was 128), making room in upper
  memory for the kits' code.
- **The helper's interrupts** are now 9Ch to FEh (and 60h to 65h); the
  message when they are in use says so.

**Documentation**
- **Kits, planned:** DEVELOPMENT.md has the design for kits (three for each
  class, for characters of one class) and what research says about building
  them: room in the helper, the sheet byte for the kit, the creation page, and
  each effect's hook, found or still to find. Revised: the Lifebinder's,
  Battle Mage's, Arcanist's, Stalker's, Myrmidon's and Shinobi's kits (the
  Shinobi with a list of its own of 14 spells); the Raider made the Ravager
  (+1 to hit and damage in melee, a base AC by level; no missile or thrown
  weapons, no shield, light armour only); the Brute +2 to hit and damage with
  a two-handed melee weapon, in place of its score changes; the Wanderer
  resisting fire and cold (+3 on saves) for AC 1 worse; the Arena Champion
  by its shield (+1 to hit and damage in melee and AC 1 better with one, −1
  to hit in melee without) instead of by the ground under it.

## Pull request #30 ([merged 2026-10-08](https://github.com/daaki85/darksun-companion-mod/pull/30))

**Release**
- **Templar's Ledger 1.2.0:** the version is 1.2.0, with its notes in
  `release-notes/v1.2.0.md` (pull requests #19 to #29), listed on the front
  page with the others.

## Pull request #29 ([merged 2026-10-08](https://github.com/daaki85/darksun-companion-mod/pull/29))

**Changed**
- **A ranger's bow is its own** with class restrictions: a multiclass ranger
  may use bows whatever its cleric sphere allows (a fire cleric/ranger, whose
  sphere allows only obsidian), and a human ranger turned cleric gets the bow
  back with its chosen weapon spec, once the cleric level passes the ranger's.
  Before, its bow expertise was there but no bow could be readied.

**Documentation**
- **What it does**, on the front page and in the guide alike: what the Ledger
  shows of the game's hidden rolls, how it brings the rules closer to AD&D,
  what it adds to Athas and on the screen, and its quality of life changes,
  in place of the old description and lists.
- **Two weapons** is a section of its own, beside Thieves and Saving throws
  (the game's rule, then AD&D's penalties), rather than under The dice log.

## Pull request #28 ([merged 2026-10-08](https://github.com/daaki85/darksun-companion-mod/pull/28))

**Changed**
- **Options tab:** a **Thieves** section of its own, after Rule changes, with
  AD&D's thief skills, hiding to backstab (and the cloak, boots and belt) and
  picking pockets (and the P key), as the guide's Thieves section has them;
  the weapon specialization box is shorter.
- **Warriors shoot faster from 7th level** with a missile weapon they
  haven't specialized in, as their melee goes from 1 to 3/2: a bow 3 a round
  (was 2), a sling, staff sling or chatkcha 3/2 (was 1). Specialists keep their
  rates, a step ahead at every level.
- **The arena's ring is one of the new items:** New items, magical and mundane
  switches it too; its own box is gone.
- **The red rings are under Controls,** with Tab and Enter, as the guide has
  them; scrolling with the right button is a line under the mouse wheel's.
- **The Ledger's window:** Show details and Show unlabelled rolls are on the
  Dice log tab, above the log, rather than in an Options section of their own;
  Save layout and Reload layout are on the Memory tools tab, leaving the top
  row to starting the game, its window, the text size and Reconnect; a byte's
  decoding has a line of its own.
- **"Not connected"** says to start the game with Start the game, rather than
  naming a command-line option.
- **A character's card** leaves out empty lines (a non-warrior's weapon
  specs), rather than showing a blank one.

**Documentation**
- **Guide reorganised:** Every magic item and Every mundane weapon in a section
  of their own, Item tables (they list the game's items too, not only new
  content); Suggested system requirements under Requirements, linked from Game
  speed; Picking pockets moved to Thieves; weapon specialization tidied
  (repeated notes gone, one table heading for every warrior, "weapon spec" for
  the kinds throughout, as the creation pages call them, and every ranger's bow
  expertise said first).
- The two Two weapons sections are one; the Effects screen's click (a spell
  left on) has a section under Controls, where its box is.
- **Guide read through:** the game's own saving throws (petrification/
  polymorph, the doubled d20) explained once, under Saving throws; the crash
  sections one; Show Save with the practice program under Without the game;
  the Characters tab's card as a list; the backstab table with the new
  weapons (a bone axe and a pick can backstab); sixteen rule changes, not
  fifteen; technical notes (patch addresses, drawing costs) moved to
  DEVELOPMENT; old-save notes gone.
- **Screenshots retaken** with the game installed (its title lettering,
  portraits and figures): the dice log, the Dialogue tab, the practice
  program and a thief's card; the backstab table checked against the game's
  item data (named long swords weigh 10 to 40).

## Pull request #27 ([merged 2026-10-07](https://github.com/daaki85/darksun-companion-mod/pull/27))

**Changed**
- **No bow to choose for a ranger** at creation (nor in the catch-up pick at
  a level gained, for a ranger with no kind yet): every ranger has expertise
  with the bow already.

**Documentation**
- Where a ranger's bow expertise and missile weapons' rates show, and the
  Options tab's weapon specialization box, mention them.

## Pull request #26 ([merged 2026-10-07](https://github.com/daaki85/darksun-companion-mod/pull/26))

**Changed**
- **Missile specialists shoot faster:** with weapon specialization, a fighter
  or gladiator with a chosen bow, sling, staff sling or chatkcha shoots faster
  by level: a bow 3 a round, then 4 from 7th level; a sling, staff sling or
  chatkcha 3/2, then 2 (AD&D's specialist's rate for the sling, a step above
  it for the others). A grand master shoots once more a round, as in melee.
  Before, missiles kept the game's rate. The Characters tab shows each missile
  weapon's rate.
- **Rangers and the bow:** every ranger has expertise with the bow on top of
  the kind it chooses, and a ranger's expertise with a missile weapon now
  gives the same rate of fire, with no other bonus.

**Documentation**
- **Attacks a round:** a table in the guide by skill (non-warriors, a kind not
  chosen, expertise, specialized, mastery, grand mastery) and level, for
  melee, bows and the other missile weapons.

## Pull request #25 ([merged 2026-10-07](https://github.com/daaki85/darksun-companion-mod/pull/25))

**Added**
- **Bone and obsidian great axes and a bone dagger,** each with an icon of its
  own. A warrior's starting great axe is now bone (obsidian for a fire or earth
  cleric), and a water cleric's starting dagger bone. Water and fire clerics'
  warriors can now choose the great axe, and water clerics' (a water
  cleric/psionicist among them) the dagger.
- **Replacements for what breaks:** the Weapon Merchant sells great axes in
  all three materials, the metal pick and the bone dagger; Jark sells bone and
  obsidian great axes and the bone dagger; every Wild Mul carries a bone great
  axe. Kel sells two sets of Thieves' Tools.
- **Defilers leave a body:** each of the game's two kinds of defiler carries a
  dagger, one obsidian and one bone. The game leaves no body for someone who
  carried nothing.
- **Mindshard from Maris's pocket:** a thief can lift it, as Shadowseeker and
  Gutterknot, for 200 XP.

**Changed**
- **One box for the new items:** the Options tab's four item boxes are one,
  **New items, magical and mundane**. The arena's ring keeps its own box, and
  the "Give thieving tools now" button is gone (Kel sells them).
- **Weapons off the allies:** Krikor's bone axe, Uskuye's metal great axe and
  Lt. Kwerin's metal pick are gone; the Weapon Merchant sells the metal ones.
- **The Sunking Crown** gives Protection from Evil, not the 10' Radius one.

**Fixed**
- **The game's Sling +1** (in a chest) showed a blank icon: its picture was
  missing from the game's data. It now has one, the Sling's with a glow.

**Documentation**
- **Item icons** in every item table of the guide.
- **[Every magic item](darksun-companion/README.md#every-magic-item)** and
  **[Every mundane weapon](darksun-companion/README.md#every-mundane-weapon):**
  each item, the game's and the Ledger's, with its bonus or power and who
  sells or carries it; the magic weapons of each kind for weapon
  specialization.
- **Mundane items** in a table of their own in New items, and the Ledger's
  weapons in the acid saving throw table.

## Pull request #24 ([merged 2026-10-07](https://github.com/daaki85/darksun-companion-mod/pull/24))

**Added**
- **Magic weapons for the classes that had too few,** each with an icon of its
  own and a story from Alagorn:
  - **Galefang,** a metal dagger +2 an air cleric can wield (a new item type:
    none of the game's daggers are an air cleric's), on the Rogue Shaman;
  - **Mindshard,** an obsidian short sword +1, on Maris, and **Stillwater,** a
    bone short sword +1, in the chest Chaya gives as her apology: a
    psionicist's, alone or with a cleric's;
  - **Linebreaker,** a metal polearm +2, on the Troop Leader, and
    **Thornwall,** a bone polearm +1, on the slave pens' weapon rack in place
    of one of its two plain ones (the rack gets an object of its own: the
    Lower Castle's is the same object).
  - Alagorn's weapons menu now has more items than a script has locals: the
    last are kept in the Ledger's flags.

**Fixed**
- **Drakejaw** (pull request #23) was never on its Magera: the game read its
  own Gemfields region, not the Ledger's copy, which DSCLOG now opens instead.

## Pull request #23 ([merged 2026-10-07](https://github.com/daaki85/darksun-companion-mod/pull/23))

**Added**
- **Three magic axes,** each with an icon of its own and a story from Alagorn:
  - **Drakejaw,** a bone axe +1, on one of the Magera guarding the wagon's
    prisoners (he gets an object of his own);
  - **Glasshewer,** an obsidian axe +2, on the elven slavers' Templar;
  - **Headsman,** a metal great axe +2, in the arena Announcer's stash.
  - Alagorn's weapons are told by a copy of his script 213 (222), so no
    script overflows the game's script buffer.

**Changed**
- **The Elven Leader's Gythka is +2** (was +1). It also no longer takes
  Kreenfang's icon, which any Gythka +1 did.

## Pull request #22 ([merged 2026-10-07](https://github.com/daaki85/darksun-companion-mod/pull/22))

**Changed**
- **Cermak, of the game's own party, specializes in the long sword and the
  axe** (was the club), which count once his gladiator levels do again.

## Pull request #21 ([merged 2026-10-07](https://github.com/daaki85/darksun-companion-mod/pull/21))

**Added**
- **The Tome of Understanding,** Father Garyn's gift when the party brings
  him the ranike pith: read like a scroll (right-click it, click its icon),
  it gives the reader a point of WIS for good (at most 25) and is used up.
  The game's book, with a night-steel cover and an emblem in the fire colours
  of its magic items.
- **The game's own party made ready for the rule changes,** for a new
  player who presses START GAME: Gerakis specializes in the long sword and
  the gythka and carries a bone gythka in place of his club, K'ratchek
  specializes in the chatkcha, Cermak in the long sword and the club, and
  Cilla, a druid who can't wear armour, has her leather armour taken away
  and knows Armor instead.
- **The Warden's Plate,** plate mail +1 in four pieces (with the magic
  weapons' switch): the **Helm** on Dagolar's body (Cloak of Bravery while
  worn), the **Arms** in the Lower Castle's treasure chest with Dark Flame,
  the **Legs** in the Gemfields' chest, the **Chest** on Balkazar's body
  (Resist Fire while worn). Plate is AC 3 chest, 2 arms, 2 legs (DSCLOG's new
  item types), each +1; the helm is the game's metal helm +1. Each piece
  has an icon of its own and is drawn on the figures.
- **The Cloak and Boots of Elvenkind** (with the magic weapons' switch): the
  cloak is the Elven Leader's gift with his Gythka +1, the boots are in
  the buried chest of Kel's caravan. Thieves and rangers only (multiclasses
  too). With the hiding rule, the cloak's wearer hides in shadows on 95 or
  less under the open sky, 90 under a roof (not halved by the light), and the
  boots' moves silently on 95 or less; their item boxes say so (`Hide 90-95%`,
  `Move 95%`).
- **The Flame Blade,** an obsidian long sword +1 (with the magic weapons'
  switch) whose blade casts the fire clerics' Focus Heat on what it hits (2d6
  fire, a save for half), as the game's Dark Flame does Burning Hands: in
  the pack of the Hot Springs' Templar. Obsidian, so a fire cleric can wield
  it.
- **Alagorn knows every new magic item,** each in the menu the game would put
  it in: the Flame Blade, the Warden's Plate (a part of Haldren's story for
  each piece), the Cloak and Boots of Elvenkind, the Bracers of Defense,
  Arrowbane, the Sunking Crown, Inixhide, the Rings and Cloak of Protection
  and the Tome of Understanding.
  - One story for each kind, as with the game's own items: the four pairs of
    bracers share one, and so do both rings.
  - His clothes, rings and other items are told by copies of his script 212
    (220 and 221), so no script overflows the game's script buffer.

**Fixed**
- **Alagorn's clothes with none carried:** he said "no magic clothes", then
  "Ah, magic clothes" and showed an empty menu. The game's two nested tests
  for clothes are now kept.
- **Armor, spell 0, was missing from the Ledger:** the Spells tab left it
  out and the dice log would have named it "spell 0"; the game numbers its
  spells from 0.
- **No manual check:** the dragon asking for a word from the manual when the
  party first leaves the sewers (the game's copy protection) no longer
  comes; the game goes on as if it had been answered.
- **The Ledger's window started with an error** (an indentation slip in its
  Options code since pull request #20); a test now compiles every module.

**Changed**
- **The world's new items are in the game's own data,** not added while you
  play: the launcher writes them into their people's and chests' objects, so a
  new game makes them where they belong. The slave pens' items (Kurzak's
  Shadowseeker and helm, Legcrusher's armour, Pehtucl's cloak and ring) and
  Kreenfang (the arena's dead body's gythka) are in the data too. The Boots
  of Elvenkind are in the buried chest when it is dug up; the bone scale
  set's arm and leg pieces and helm are in the slave pens' chest with its
  chest piece; one Castle Guard and one Undermountain miner have objects of
  their own for their items. The Options tab's switches take effect from the
  next start, in regions not yet visited.
- **The Elven Leader gives the Cloak of Elvenkind himself,** after his
  Gythka +1, with a line of his own; when it can't be carried he leaves it on
  the ground beside him, as the Gythka.
- **Grey's Scale's arm and leg armour are AC 3** (the game's are 2).
- **A new warrior with a staff sling keeps its shield,** as with a bow: both
  go in the missile slot, and the game asks nothing of the hands for them (the
  shield went into the backpack before).
- **The magic weapons and Legcrusher's leather have names:** the Club +1 is
  **Gutterknot**, the Pick +1 **Deepbiter**, the Staff Sling +1 **Windlash**,
  the Short Sword +2 **Greenbright** and the Leather Chest Armor +1
  **Inixhide**, each with a story from Alagorn. Greenbright is now on **Arant**, who holds the captured
  gladiators (the Elite Guards are only in the final fight). A thief can
  lift Gutterknot from Churrr's pocket, for 200 XP, as Shadowseeker from
  Kurzak's.
- **A circlet and a crown, worn on the head and not armour** (with the magic
  weapons' switch): **Arrowbane**, a silver circlet sold by Kel, keeps
  Protection from Normal Missiles on its wearer; the **Sunking Crown**, worn
  by Keldar, Protection from Evil, 10' Radius. Neither gives AC, stops bracers
  of defense or a preserver's spells. Each has an icon of its own and is
  drawn on the figures (a silver band with a stone; a gold band with points).
- **Bracers of defense give nothing with a helm on**, as with any armour; a
  shield and rings and cloaks of protection still go with them.
- **The documents are shorter and better organised:** the front page gives an
  overview and only the latest pull request's news; the guide's dice log lines
  are grouped by topic, its internals moved to DEVELOPMENT.md (with the
  command-line use), and its new items described once; released pull requests
  here are summarised.
- **The README's new items** are one item to a row, with the prices and the
  Options tab's boxes after the table; the ranger's row no longer names a
  fighter/ranger (the game has none).

## Pull request #20 ([merged 2026-10-07](https://github.com/daaki85/darksun-companion-mod/pull/20))

**Added**
- **The new plain weapons in the world** (a new content switch, on by default):
  the Weapon Merchant and Jark sell the bone and obsidian short swords and axes,
  the obsidian mace and (the Weapon Merchant) a plain metal short sword; Merzol,
  Krikor and Chaero carry one, and every Tari in the warrens, Renegade and Wild
  Mul has one as loot.
- **Bracers of defense** (a new content switch with the magic weapons, on by
  default): AC 6 on Mikquetzl, AC 5 on Wyrmias, AC 4 on Balkazar and AC 2 on
  Dagolar, 20,000 to 40,000; worn on the arms, nothing while armour is worn on the arms, legs or
  chest, and not armour to the class rules (a preserver casts in them).
- **Magic weapons of the kinds the game has none of:** a Club +1 on Churrr
  in the warrens, a stone Pick +1 on one of the Undermountain folk, a Staff
  Sling +1 sold by the Bowyer and a metal Short Sword +2 on an Elite Guard,
  each with an icon of its own and priced as the game prices its own: the
  melee ones as its Obsidian Bloodwrath +1, 20,800 a plus; the staff sling as
  its Sling +1, 2,800.
- **Metal daggers, maces, great axes, picks and polearms** (the game has none
  plain): one each on Tobrian, a Templar of the slavers' camp, Uskuye, Kwerin
  and a Castle Guard; an earth cleric may now take the great axe and the
  polearm, and starts with a metal one.
- **Weapon specialization** (a new rule change, on by default): fighters and
  gladiators specialize in kinds of weapon (+1 to hit, +2 damage), fighters
  on to mastery at 5th level (+3, +3) and grand mastery at 9th (the damage
  die a size larger and an attack more), rangers take expertise; a warrior
  with a weapon of another kind attacks at AD&D's plain rate. Sixteen kinds,
  chosen on the creation screen's new **WEAPON SPEC** pages (greyed as the
  game's disciplines are, a multiclass warrior's limited to the kinds it may
  use some weapon of, in any material: a fire cleric's obsidian long sword),
  a new warrior starting with a plain weapon of its kind in a material it may
  use (new bone short swords and axes, obsidian ones for fire and earth
  clerics, as the game has only Kurzak's short sword and a metal axe; an
  obsidian mace pictured without Blackmace's glow; a plain great axe pictured
  without the Great Axe +3's gem; a two-handed weapon puts
  the starting shield in the backpack); a
  gladiator's 3rd and 4th (and any warrior's from before the rule) picked at
  a level gained, in the game's own pop-up for a psionicist's new power; the
  kinds listed on the **Effects** screen and counted on the DAM lines and in
  the dice log. The Characters tab lists each character's kinds
  (`Weapons: long sword (grand mastery)`) and gives the attacks a round with
  each weapon held (`Attacks: 3/2 a round with Long Sword, 1 with Axe`).
- **Class restrictions** (a new rule change, on by default): psionicists,
  multiclass thieves, preservers, druids and clerics held to their own limits
  on armour, shields and weapons whatever their other classes allow, the
  strictest winning; a multiclass preserver casts no spells in armour (its
  spell slots headed **NO SPELLS IN ARMOUR** on the USE screen, and
  "(no spells in armour)" on the Characters tab).
- **Multiclass hit points** (a new rule change, on by default): each level's
  die and CON's bonus divided between a character's classes, as in AD&D, at
  creation and at every level; the dice log shows the share. Meant for a new
  game: ticked during one, a character's next level shares CON's bonus for
  all its levels.
- **Hit dice: the better of two** (a new rule change, on by default): every
  character's hit die is rolled twice, at creation and at each level, and the
  better roll kept; the dice log shows both.

**Fixed**
- **The Characters tab read the game as if every rule were off** (its
  THAC0, attacks and specialization lines): it now uses the rules ticked.
- **Character creation in the dice log:** one click on the die rolls a whole
  character several times while it tumbles, and the log gave every one; when
  rolls came too fast to record, the hit point line took CON from an earlier
  one (37 logged where the game had 40). Now only the character the die stops
  on is logged, each ability and the hit points checked against what the
  screen shows (`DEX 19 (its rolls came too fast to record)`).
- **"No hit point roll" on a level gained:** the dice log said the game rolls
  hit points only when a character's highest class level rises. It rolls for
  every new class level; a level that leaves the most hit points unchanged
  only added a fraction (the game divides the whole total by the classes).

**Changed**
- **The Ledger's magic items are priced as the game's own:** the Rings and the
  Cloak of Protection +1 15,000 (were 5,000), Leather Chest Armor +1 6,000
  (was 3,000); ones already given are repriced. Kreenfang 20,800 (was
  18,000), as the game's Gythka +1.
- **The README is shorter** (2,974 lines to about 2,300): how each part works
  (the helper's interrupts, the game's offsets and flags), how the dice log
  works, what's known of the game's data and the development notes are in a
  new `darksun-companion/DEVELOPMENT.md`, each README section linking to its
  part; "What it does" is a short overview; the thieves' skills and backstabs,
  and the saving throws, are each one section with their rule changes, and the
  two-weapon rule sits with the dice log's two weapons; the new items are one
  section with a table, Kalzith and Semyon one of new people told as a player
  meets them; and the helms' and boots' rules are one.

## Pull request #19 ([merged 2026-10-06](https://github.com/daaki85/darksun-companion-mod/pull/19))

**Added**
- **Which class levels up next, on View Character:** for a character of more
  than one class, the XP in brackets on the experience line now names the
  class that reaches its next level there: `EXP:87230 (90000 Pr)`. A letter
  for each class, but **Pr** and **Ps** for preserver and psionicist (both
  start with P); both named when two level up at the same XP
  (`(20000 Pr/T)`); a class already at the highest level never named. One
  class: as before. (The patched game's `INT D2h`, where the game adds the
  bracket.)

**Fixed**
- **Kalzith's prices:** Blur 6,000 (was 3,000) and Haste 9,000 (was 12,000).
  They were taken from the game's scrolls with the spell numbers read one off
  (Wall of Fog's and Flame Arrow's); the game has no scroll of either, so
  they're its price for the spell's level, 3,000 a level. His stock is
  repriced when the Ledger next sees the game.

**Changed**
- **Kalzith sells Shield and Burning Hands** in place of Magic Missile and
  Color Spray (3,000 each), so none of his scrolls is one the game has
  (Color Spray's is in the sewers). Magic Missile and Color Spray scrolls he
  stocked before become Shield and Burning Hands, wherever they are.

## Pull request #18 ([merged 2026-10-06](https://github.com/daaki85/darksun-companion-mod/pull/18))

- **Release 1.1.0:** the version, its notes, and pull request #17 marked
  merged in the READMEs.

## Pull request #17 ([merged 2026-10-06](https://github.com/daaki85/darksun-companion-mod/pull/17))

**Changed**
- **Kalzith's scrolls at the game's prices:** 3,000 to 12,000 ceramic: the
  game's own price for a scroll of the same spell, else its price for the
  spell's level.
- **A monster's alignment in the Look box:** `THAC0 17 AL TN`, the alignment
  in two letters; the description in the dialogue window and the dice log's
  `Look:` line name it in words.
- **The Options tab's sections open and close:** each group of switches is
  under a heading to click, so the tab is short; which are open is remembered.
- **The whole party walks as fast as the leader alone, at the fastest game
  speed:** the Ledger's shadows and dust are drawn much more cheaply, and look
  the same.
- **Cloaks and boots say what they do:** with the cloak and boots bonuses on,
  their item box says `Hide +10` or `Move +10` under the name.
- **Boots are named "Boots (Speed+1)"** for the boots rule, so their extra
  move in a fight isn't mistaken for the item box's `Move +10`.
- **Plain cloaks, boots and belts cost 24** (the Leather Cloak was 20); magic
  ones keep their prices.

**Added**
- **Searching junk, hay and wardrobes in the dice log:** each search's roll,
  what it found, and how far the count of finds has got; a rat's bite or a
  falling pot shows its damage roll.
- **More saves:** 40 instead of the game's 10, on four pages of ten in the
  save and load window: PAGE 1 to PAGE 4 buttons under EXIT, and PgDn and PgUp
  for the next page and the one before.
- **More characters:** 29 saved characters instead of the game's 19.
- **Rule change: items saving against acid:** a worn piece of armour or a
  held melee weapon the Rampager's acid or the Babau's corroding touch could
  destroy needs the easier of the game's number and AD&D's save against acid
  for its material, less its plus and 1 more for a magical power.
- **Rule change: rings and cloaks of protection as in AD&D:** of two rings
  only the better counts; a ring gives no AC with magical armour; a cloak of
  protection does nothing with magical armour, metal armour or a shield in
  either hand, natural armour being fine.
- **A worn belt helps a thief:** +5 to picking pockets and opening locks,
  counted by the game's own lock picking and by the Ledger; its item box says
  `Pick +5, Lock +5`.
- **Kreenfang and Shadowseeker:** the 2 handed Bone Gythka on the dead body
  by the stone arch in the arena is Kreenfang, a gythka +1, and Kurzak's short
  sword is Shadowseeker, a short sword +1 whose wielder sees the invisible.
- **Alagorn knows Kreenfang and Shadowseeker:** the Painted Badlands wizard
  who identifies magic items has each in his menus when the party carries it,
  with a story of its own.
- **200 XP for lifting Kurzak's sword:** the conversation says the thief lifts
  "a metal short sword" and receives 200 experience points, with the quest's
  sound, given by the game's own routine for a quest's XP.

**Fixed**
- A bug of the game's own: DELETE in the roster deleted the character in the
  row clicked counted from the top of the list, not of what was shown, so with
  the list scrolled down another character was deleted.
- **Kalzith's and Semyon's questions are asked once a talk:** a reply that
  doesn't end the talk leaves the list once chosen, as the game's own people's
  do, and is back the next time you talk to them.
- **The load window shows an empty page:** PAGE 2 to PAGE 4 did nothing in the
  load window when that page had no saves.
- **Gear on the figures:** walking side-on, a shield showed nowhere; now it is
  held forward of the chest, its near half showing.
- A character not yet played counted as not Okay: a New thief's skills all
  showed 0 on the inventory screen.
- The Look box no longer shows an AC the Ledger worked out for another
  creature: the arena's first fight comes too soon after the opening one to
  tell them apart by the game's time, and a Slig showed the opening fight's
  Defiler's AC -9.
- The Ledger's new item pictures no longer wipe an item's spell: changing an
  icon cleared four bytes of the item where the game's picture cache is two.

## Pull request #16 ([merged 2026-10-04](https://github.com/daaki85/darksun-companion-mod/pull/16))

**Added**
- **Semyon breaks out with Scar:** recruit Semyon before the fight with Scar,
  take up Scar's offer to break out, and Semyon comes along to the slave pens
  with Scar's men, fights the guards on the party's side, and has a line of
  his own for the breakout.

- **Game speed on the Options tab:** the launcher gives DOSBox 20,000 cycles
  by default; GOG's own speed and 30,000 can be chosen, with suggested system
  requirements for each in the companion's README.
- **Faster walking with gear shown:** the party's figure pictures keep only
  the room their gear needs while walking.
- **New content switches:** Kalzith, Semyon, the cooked vulture, the slave
  pens' gear, a worn cloak's and boots' bonuses to hiding, and the Effects
  screen's click keeping a spell can each be switched off on the Options tab.
- **Crash reports:** when DOSBox crashes or the game stops with an error, the
  game's message stays on screen and the Ledger saves a report in `crash-logs`
  with how it closed, what was on screen, the switches, and the end of the
  dice log and dialogue.
- **The Trustee knows Semyon got away:** if Semyon broke out with the party
  and lived, the Trustee says so after the escape, instead of "Every single
  one" for all the pens.

**Changed**
- **Kalzith and the alarm:** while the escape's alarm sounds he has a line for
  the party and no talk, as the pens' other slaves do.
- **A vanished bone scale piece is written up:** the set is still given once a
  game and never again; should the Bone Helm, or the arm or leg piece, vanish,
  the Ledger saves a report on what became of it in `crash-logs`, and the log
  says so.
- **Finding the Ring +1 is worth 50 XP** to whoever searches the Tied-up
  Prisoner's body, given as the game gives a quest's, once.
- **Picking pockets with the Thieves' Tools only, by default:** the Options
  tab's switch is now about the tools, and P in a conversation is a choice
  under it, off unless ticked.
- **The READMEs reorganised,** each with a table of contents: the guide's
  sections grouped as the Options tab is, the window's guide beside how to
  start it, the memory-mapping steps under Development; this changelog moved
  out of the main README into its own file.

**Fixed**
- **A crash in the opening fight:** when the game couldn't make the first of
  two drawing areas of the map's view, it freed the second one anyway with a
  number it had never set.
- **The bone scale set in a second new game:** the Ledger remembered it as
  given across games, so a later new game never had it; it is now kept for
  each game.
- **Thieves' Tools clicked between turns** (as an area changes) stopped the
  dice log with an error.
- **The game's flags** were read and written through a null pointer at times;
  the Ledger's guard stopped the writes.
- **Crash messages readable:** a game that stopped in graphics mode left its
  error message invisible; the screen goes back to text before the message.

**Fixed** (from a review of the code)
- **Clicks after Tab + Enter:** for a few seconds after Enter, anything the
  next character clicked could still count as the enemy chosen before.
- **Kalzith and Semyon in fights:** people past the map's 256th thing were
  missing from the Ledger's list of who is in a fight: no ring, no Tab, no HP
  lines, no "killed" line for them.
- **A thief who went last and is next** after someone first who can't act lost
  their turn line and hiding roll.
- **Two halved hits seen together** were put down to the first, and the second
  later logged as doing nothing.
- **The mouse wheel's watch** (Windows) was started again on every reconnect
  without stopping the last one.
- **Kalzith only with his object:** a copy of the game whose objects lack what
  he is made from no longer gets his scripts; a clash over his scrolls'
  pictures no longer loses every icon.
- **Speed:** the rings' and dust's colour tables are worked out once for a
  palette, not every 30 seconds.

## Pull request #15 ([merged 2026-10-04](https://github.com/daaki85/darksun-companion-mod/pull/15))

- **READMEs after pull request #14:** the changelog, the cooked vulture quest
  and its screenshot, and the new log lines.

## Pull request #14 ([merged 2026-10-04](https://github.com/daaki85/darksun-companion-mod/pull/14))

**Added**
- **What the party wears, on the map:** each character's figure shows their
  weapons and shields, bow and quiver on the back, armour, helms as circlets,
  cloaks, boots and belts, walking and fighting, and changes as soon as their
  gear does.
- **Kalzith, a defiler in the slave pens:** a slave the templars put in the
  arena now and then, kept in a pen of his own, with a face of his own.
- **Semyon in the slave pens,** once he has left the arena: in a pen of his
  own above Kalzith's, with his own conversation.
- **Dinos and the Trustee know about them:** their "who else is in here"
  questions also ask about Kalzith, and about Semyon once he is in the pens;
  if either is killed, they speak of him as of the game's dead.
- **Shadows under every figure on the map:** each living creature's outline,
  laid down toward the lower right, see-through and in the floor's own
  colours, drawn on the floor before the walls and figures, so everything in
  front stands on them.
- **Scrolling the map with the mouse:** pressing the wheel and moving drags
  the map with the pointer, in fights too, and in Windows turning the wheel
  scrolls it.
- **Dust behind walking feet:** puffs on sand and dirt behind anyone walking,
  spreading and fading in about a second, under the walls and figures.
- **Choosing an enemy with Tab, attacking it with Enter:** on a party member's
  turn in a fight, Tab picks an enemy, marked by a red ring, with the view
  scrolled to it; Enter attacks it as a click on it would, even when someone
  stands in front of it.
- **Hits that do less than rolled** in the dice log: a weapon hit that took
  part of its damage, or none, with what the monster's defences say.
- **The quest sound for the vulture:** giving Dinos the cooked vulture plays
  the sound the game plays when a quest is done.
- **Cloaks and boots help thieves and rangers hide:** with the stealth rule, a
  worn cloak adds 10 to hiding in shadows and worn boots 10 to moving
  silently, up to 95.
- **Regeneration in the dice log:** a hit point back by itself, which the game
  gives anyone with CON 20 or more, is logged as such.
- **A safety net against stray writes:** the Ledger never writes over the
  start of memory or the first bytes of the game's data; a write stopped there
  is named in the dice log.

**Changed**
- **The Effects screen no longer ends a spell's effect when its icon is
  clicked** .
- **Windows' security warning only once:** after the first `.bat` file is let
  through, the Ledger takes the download mark off the files in its own folder,
  so the others start without asking.
- **The vulture quest is part of Dinos's talk:** while the party carries the
  cooked vulture, his first menu has "We cooked the vulture from the arena."
  just before "Goodbye." His answer is in his own dialogue window, with his
  portrait, and the XP comes as the game's quests give it, in the game's own
  window; the vulture is no longer used on him from the inventory.
- **Cat's Grace's icon** is a cat's paw print instead of a cat's face.
- **Dinos's vulture lines** are his own words, without narration (the game's
  conversations are people speaking).

**Fixed**
- **DOSBox crashes, garbled figures, freezes and "Null pointer assignment":**
  the gear writer kept writing a party picture over memory the game had freed
  and given to something else.
- **Kalzith said he had nothing left to sell** after one purchase: while a
  save loaded, the Ledger could read the new game's flags with the last game's
  Kalzith and mark it sold out.
- **The vulture's reward in the dice log when a game was loaded,** and its XP
  and rest given then: the flag was read from memory still being loaded.
- **A thief first in a round didn't hide:** someone who had the last turn of
  one round and the first of the next got no new turn in the log, so no hide
  in shadows or move silently roll.
- **Tab + Enter froze the game:** after Enter, the walk to the chosen enemy
  stalled, sometimes until a mouse click.
- **The party's gear showed late after an area change:** the Ledger looked for
  the area's newly loaded pictures only every 10 seconds, and dressed the
  party with its slower checks; a party walking off as the area loaded stayed
  plain meanwhile.
- **Cat's Grace was missing from the Effects screen:** its effect had no icon
  in the game's table of effects, and the screen shows only effects with one.
- **Kalzith's scrolls cast their spell instead of teaching it:** the game
  teaches only from scroll objects numbered 1400 to 1499, and his were 1001 to
  1006.
- **Figures' shadows fell the wrong way:** they lay toward the lower left,
  while the walls', bones' and stones' shadows on the maps fall toward the
  lower right.
- **Kalzith's and Semyon's Look box** sometimes lacked the HP, AC and THAC0
  lines: the Ledger only looked among the map's first 256 things, and the game
  numbers them anew, sometimes past that.
- **The slave pens broken by Kalzith:** Kurzak vanished after leading the
  party in, people were missing, Merzol didn't stop the party, the doors'
  "pick the lock" and "knock" and the main door's "Summon Kurzak!" were gone
  and the water jug couldn't be filled.
- **Kalzith's scrolls taught the spell before their own** .
- **"Who are you?" hung the game** when asked of Kalzith.
- **Pickpocketing said "won't get another chance" to everyone** in a new game
  with the same party: the last game's tries were remembered.
- **Figures taking extra steps after their turn in a fight:** to have figures
  drawn again with their shadows, the Ledger marked them "changed", which in a
  fight could set one walking again after its turn.
- **"Killed" lines for everyone in an area the party left:** walking from the
  slave pens into the arena logged most of the pens as "is killed".

## Pull request #13 ([merged 2026-10-02](https://github.com/daaki85/darksun-companion-mod/pull/13))

**Added**
- **The Release workflow can be run by hand**, making the version's tag.

## Pull request #12 ([merged 2026-10-02](https://github.com/daaki85/darksun-companion-mod/pull/12))

**Added**
- **Release 1.0.0:** the version, its release notes, and a workflow that
  builds the release zip.

## Pull request #11 ([merged 2026-10-02](https://github.com/daaki85/darksun-companion-mod/pull/11))

**Added**
- **Cat's Grace looks like itself:** its own icon and its own description in
  the spell box, instead of Flaming Sphere's.

**Fixed**
- **The slave pens' gear given twice** to a game loaded after it was given:
  none of it is given where it is already in the game.
- **Prices:** Leather Chest Armor +1 is worth 3000, the Cloak of Protection +1
  5000 and the Rings of Protection +1 5000, as magic items; ones already in a
  game are repriced.
- **Dinos takes the vulture as soon as a fight is over:** the Ledger now
  reads the game's own combat flag.
- **Thieves' Tools can't be used in a fight**, only out of one.
- **The dice log and the Dialogue tab keep up with the newest lines** ;
  scrolling up to read back still holds the place.
- **The bone scale set added twice** to a game loaded after it was added: it
  is now added only where none of its pieces is.
- **No more log lines for the Ledger's items** handed out: they're there to be
  found.
- **The Bone Helm** can only be worn by those who can wear bone scale armour
  (not thieves).

**Changed**
- **Getting started:** open the Ledger first, pick the options, then **Start
  the game** from it.

## Pull request #10 ([merged 2026-10-02](https://github.com/daaki85/darksun-companion-mod/pull/10))

**Fixed**
- **Half-giants' two-handed weapons in one hand:** the rule didn't take
  effect.

## Pull request #9 ([merged 2026-10-02](https://github.com/daaki85/darksun-companion-mod/pull/9))

**Added**
- **Rule change: thief skills from AD&D's table.** A skill is AD&D's average
  for the thief level, plus the race's adjustment, plus Dark Sun's DEX
  adjustment.
- **The bone scale set:** where the Bone Scale Chest Armor is found, its arm
  and leg pieces and a new Bone Helm, coloured to match, are found with it.
- **Rule change: half-giants wield two-handed weapons in one hand,** with a
  shield or a light weapon in the other.
- **Names in colour in the dice log:** each party member's in a colour of
  their own, monsters' in red, bold, all at 4.5:1 contrast or more.

**Fixed**
- **A game that stops with an error** leaves its message on screen, and the
  dice log says how DOSBox closed, telling a crash of DOSBox's own apart.
- **Picking a pocket after loading a save:** a try made after the save is
  forgotten when it's loaded, so that person can be tried again.
- **XP taken away and given back between areas** is no longer logged as a loss
  and a gain; a loss that stays is logged after a minute.
- **A monster's AC in its Look box** could be an earlier fight's creature's: a
  slig in the first arena fight showed the opening fight's Defiler's AC −9.

**Changed**
- **The Options tab scrolls** when the window is too small to show it all.
- **Options:** the Ring +1, picking pockets and the thieving tools button sit
  under Rule changes, with the other changes to play.

## Pull request #8 ([merged 2026-10-02](https://github.com/daaki85/darksun-companion-mod/pull/8))

**Added**
- **Rule change: levels up to 10.** Every class can reach 10th level, at
  AD&D's XP.
- **Gear for the slave pens' bosses** (with the Ledger running, given once a
  game):
  - Kurzak: a metal Short Sword (1d6, a new item type; a thief can lift it)
    and a leather Helm;
  - Legcrusher: Leather Chest Armor +1;
  - Pehtucl: a Cloak of Protection +1 (a new item type: +1 AC and +1 on saves,
    as the ring) and a Ring of Protection +1 (a thief can lift it).
- **Rangers hide in shadows and move silently too** , with AD&D's ranger
  chances: the full chance outdoors and half indoors, the reverse of thieves.
- **Item icons of their own** for the Short Sword, Leather Chest Armor +1, the
  Cloak of Protection +1 and the two Rings of Protection +1, made from the
  game's plain ones.

**Changed**
- **Thief skills: no equipment penalty.** The game took 5 to 10 off some thief
  skills for anything in the legs slot, the quiver or either hand; it no
  longer does in games started with the dice log.
- **The inventory screen shows hide in shadows** in hear noise's place; the
  Ledger's own screens show both.
- **Pick pockets lifts a short sword** too, though it weighs more than other
  small things.

## Pull request #7 ([merged 2026-10-01](https://github.com/daaki85/darksun-companion-mod/pull/7))

**Added**
- **Rule change: AD&D's two-weapon penalties.** A non-ranger with a melee
  weapon in each hand attacks at −2 with the main hand and −4 with the off
  hand, offset by the DEX reaction adjustment.
- **Rule change: the spell save.** Spells are saved against with the spell save,
  not petrification/polymorph.
- **Rule change: DEX instead of a doubled d20.** On saves against fire, cold
  and electricity, the DEX defensive adjustment counts instead of a doubled
  d20.
- **Cat's Grace**, a new 2nd-level wizard spell in Flaming Sphere's place.
  - +1d6 DEX, at most 24, working exactly as Strength does for STR.
  - Untick the rule and Flaming Sphere is back.
- **REAC and DEF on the inventory screen.** REAC sits beside SP; DEF sits on
  the AC line.
- **Rule change: hiding in shadows to backstab.** A thief whose turn comes
  with no enemy beside them rolls hide in shadows, then move silently.
- **The cooked vulture quest.** Take the cooked vulture to Dinos in the slave
  pens: he cooks it for the party, who eat with him.
- **32 new entries in the game's item name table** , for the Ledger's own
  items.

**Changed**
- **Turn pop-ups in the game are off by default** , and have three levels: at
  the least, in short, or in detail.
- **Spell slots** only show the spell levels the character can cast.

**Fixed**
- Item names numbered past 255 were read wrongly by the Ledger (for example,
  Serpent Boots).

## Pull request #6 ([merged 2026-09-30](https://github.com/daaki85/darksun-companion-mod/pull/6))

**Fixed**
- **Boots gave no extra move.** The rule looked at the wrong equipment slot.

**Changed**
- README screenshots retaken (move silently, boots, Thieves' Tools, Options).

## Pull request #5 ([merged 2026-09-30](https://github.com/daaki85/darksun-companion-mod/pull/5))

**Added**
- A **Give thieving tools now** button on the Options tab.
- **Thieves' Tools** get a name of their own and a leather satchel's picture
  instead of a key's.

**Fixed**
- The arena ring, and the backpack cell the thieving tools went into.
- Only one set of tools per thief.

- Items named for the rule changes ("Helm (AC 1)", "Boots (+1 Move)").
- **Thief skills as they stand:** equipment penalties and effects, in the game

**Added**

    pop-up of their own;

- **Spells tab:** what every spell and psionic power does.
- **Launchers:** one for the game alone with the in-game additions, and one
  for the game and the Ledger together.

- **The first rule changes:** helms give AC 1; boots give a move more in a fight.
- **Saving throws** with each modifier named.
- **THAC0** shown with each weapon, fresh on every redraw.
- The Ring +1 (+1 AC and saves).
